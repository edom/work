- 2018-07-16: I stopped using Travis CI because `cabal new-build` ran out of memory.
- The `travis` branch
    - Pushing to this branch will trigger a rebuild.
    - This branch is meant to be rebased onto `origin/master`.
    - This branch is meant to be force-pushed.
    - The file `.travis.yml` shall stay in this branch.

        - @cabal new-build@ runs out of memory.
            - Reduce @-j4@ to @-j1@?
            - Add @optimization: False@ into @travis/cabal.config@.

- Some notes about @optional-packages@ in @cabal.project@:
    - Clone [Yi editor source](https://github.com/yi-editor/yi) into @yi@.
        - Hackage's yi-0.17.1 (Nov 2017) is not ready for GHC 8.

- Building the website
    - Serving the website: Run the script [sh/jekserve](sh/jekserve).
    - Publishing the website: Run the script [sh/pub](sh/pub).
    - Install Jekyll 3 on Ubuntu 14.04
        - See (but don't blindly follow) https://gist.github.com/Piyush3dB/b7daa3f178746c7d7479ca1cbd694160
            - Use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to install newer Ruby versions.
                - Ubuntu 14.04 Jekyll is too ancient for GitHub Pages.
                - [What are the differences between rbenv, rvm, and chruby?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22153521/what-are-the-differences-between-rbenv-rvm-and-chruby)
                    - For our use case, rbenv is best.
                    We don't want to program in Ruby.
                    We just want to install Jekyll.
    - How do we speed up Jekyll?
        - Is 6 seconds for 160 pages slow?
        - What is making it slow?
            - How do we find that out?
                - Is there a stack-sampling profiler for Ruby?
                    - Yes, `conscho` in [SO 4092641](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4092641/profiling-ruby-code) recommends `stackprof`.
