- 2018-07-16: I stopped using Travis CI because `cabal new-build` ran out of memory.
- The `travis` branch
    - Pushing to this branch will trigger a rebuild.
    - This branch is meant to be rebased onto `origin/master`.
    - This branch is meant to be force-pushed.
    - The file `.travis.yml` shall stay in this branch.

        - @cabal new-build@ runs out of memory.
            - Reduce @-j4@ to @-j1@?
            - Add @optimization: False@ into @travis/cabal.config@.

- Some notes about @optional-packages@ in @cabal.project@:
    - Clone [Yi editor source](https://github.com/yi-editor/yi) into @yi@.
        - Hackage's yi-0.17.1 (Nov 2017) is not ready for GHC 8.
- information organization
    - An information is a sentence, a paragraph, a picture, or anything that helps us accomplish something.
        - Here "information" is a countable noun.
    - Informations should be grouped by the task it helps us accomplish.
        - Every task T requires a set of informations, which should be put together in one place.
        - If doing task T requires informations J and K, then J and K should be grouped together.
        - Duplication problem.
            - Suppose: both task T and task U requires information J.
            - Where should J be put?
    - The value of information J should be measured by the ratio V/E, where V is the value of the task that J helps us accomplish, and E is our effort for obtaining J.
    - Example of combinatorial explosion of categories.
        - Which should a red car be grouped together with: a red hat or a blue car?
            - Which should a big old man be grouped together with: a big old woman, a big young man, or a small old man?
