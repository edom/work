# Contributor guidelines

Thank you for your interest!

## Procedure

- If you want to make a big change, then create a GitHub issue first to discuss about it.
- If it's a small change or an approved big change, then create a GitHub pull request.
- Optimize your work for maintainer understandability.
    - Make your commits in the way that the maintainer can understand and check your work in the shortest time with the least effort.
- Don't do unnecessary work.
    - Don't change whitespaces unnecessarily.
    - Don't change formatting unnecessarily.
    - Don't change naming conventions.
- We may need legal advice for the contributor agreement.

## Contributor agreement

- Definitions
    - The Project is an abstract entity.
        - "The Project does an action" means a Maintainer does that action, some Maintainers do that action, or all Maintainers do that action.
        - "To grant a right to the Project" ("to allow the Project to do something") means to grant that right to all Maintainers in the past, present, and future.
    - As of 2018-08-16, the Maintainers is the following list:
        - Erik Dominikus.
    - A Maintainer is an element of the Maintainers list.
    - The Work is everything in this Git repository (the Git repository containing this file).
    - "You" is all entities involved in making a Maintainer incorporate the Contribution into the Work.
    - The Contribution (your Contribution) is your part of the Work; that is the part, that you author, that is distributed with the Work.
    - It means that you must both be the author of the Contribution and the person who makes the pull request.
    - The Agreement is this whole document which is titled "Contributor agreement".
    - "Including" means including but not limited to.
    - A/B means A or B or both.
- General
    - Not knowing this document is not an excuse for not agreeing.
        - If your Contribution is in the Work, then you agree to the Agreement.
    - The spirit of this agreement is to preserve the freedom of the Work.
- Irrevocability
    - You cannot revoke your agreement to this Agreement, any part of it or the whole of it.
    All allowances in this Agreement are irrevocable.
- Transfer
    - You allow the Project to bestow/transfer, to anyone the Project wishes to, every rights that you have granted to the Project, including all the rights you grant in this Agreement.
- Ability
    - You state that you have all the rights required to incorporate your Contribution into the Work without hampering the distribution of the Work.
        - If it turns out that you don't, and anyone gets sued because of that, then you may be held responsible for part of or all of the damages due to that.
- Grants
    - You allow the Project to do *everything* that the Project wants to do to/with your Contribution in the Work, without asking for your permission, without paying you.
    "Everything" includes:
        - Redistributing your Contribution under different license/terms.
        - Selling your Contribution without giving you anything in return.
        - Using your Contribution for purposes you don't like.
        - Using your patents in your Contribution without giving you royalty.
        - Using your Contribution without being sued by you.
        - Changing your Contribution.
        - Deleting your Contribution from the Work.
        - Reusing your Contribution in another work under the license of this Work (which may change).
        - In summary, you still own your Contribution, but you allow the Project to behave as if the Project own your Contribution.
            - You can still use your Contribution outside the Work, with any terms you wish.
- Limits
    - You cannot sue anyone for any reason related to your Contribution that is distributed as a part of the Work.
        - However, if you are in the Maintainers list, you can sue for reasons related to the Work, but only for license violations.
        - Different directories of the Work can have different licenses.
        - You can still sue anyone for other reasons unrelated to the Work.
- Future changes
    - You allow the Project to change the Agreement in any way that does not increase your chance of being sued.
    - Everything in this agreement continues to hold after every change of Maintainers.
    - The Maintainers can redefine the Maintainers, without notification.
    - If a Maintainer dies, then that Maintainer is removed from the Maintainers list.
    - Inheritance law does not implicitly hold.
    If a Maintainer wishes to bequeath that Maintainer's rights, then that Maintainer must explicitly state so.
    - If the Maintainers list becomes empty, then the new Maintainers list shall be determined by community consensus in at most 30 days.
    - If community fails to reach a consensus in 30 days since the Maintainers list becomes empty, then the Project ceases to exist, and the Work is released into public domain.
        - If your law doesn't recognize public domain, then, well, what can it do?
        Everybody who can sue you is already dead.
