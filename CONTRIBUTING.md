# Contributor guidelines

## Considerations

## Procedure

- If you want to make a big change, then create a GitHub issue first to discuss about it.
- If it's a small change or an approved big change, then create a GitHub pull request.
- Optimize your work for maintainer understandability.
    - Make your commits in the way that the maintainer can understand and check your work in the shortest time with the least effort.
- Don't do unnecessary work.
    - Don't change whitespaces unnecessarily.
    - Don't change formatting unnecessarily.
    - Don't change naming conventions.

## Contributor License Agreement

(Should we just require contributors to release their contributions under public domain?
It will be much simpler.)
