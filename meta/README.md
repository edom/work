# Metaprogramming

- Goals
    - Write a metaprogram in Haskell to generate a Java 8 enterprise web application.
        - What we mean by "enterprise web application":
            - User uses web browser to interact with the application.
            - Lots of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
            - Some business logic.
            - Used internally in a small company.
            - Less than 100 users.
        - What we don't mean by "enterprise web application":
            - Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE), except Servlet API.
- Assumptions
    - The user of this library is programmer / developer / software engineer.
- Directory structure
    - Non-generated files
        - `src`: Haskell source files
        - `rt`: runtimes
            - `java`: Java runtime
        - `har`: harness for running example application
            - the non-generated part of the examples
    - Generated files
        - `src1`: stage-1 Haskell source files
