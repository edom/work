- Why are old Android phones so sluggish?
  - Combination of shitty (weak) hardware and shitty (bloated, RAM-eating) software.

* Android vs iPhone

    - Everyone can make mistakes.

    - is an advertising company
      - 96% income from online ads

  - playground analogy
    - Google is the kid who
      - has a design for big sand castle,
      - gets all the other kids to build that castle (with some strict licensing terms).
    - Apple is the kid who
      - builds the most beautiful sand castle
      - but doesn't want to play with anybody else.
- price
  - For the same hardware specs, Android phones should be much cheaper than iPhone.
- interoperability
  - Android phones use standard connectors (USB).
  - iPhone uses Apple-only connectors (Lightning).
    - There are adapters though, but sold separately?
    - Never expect any Apple hardware to just work with non-Apple hardware.
      - Either buy *everything* from Apple, or buy *nothing* from them.
        - Treat Apple as a religion.
          - You don't join a religion with half your ass. You go all-in.

- serviceability
  - You can't open the case of an iPhone.
    - You can't replace the battery of an iPhone.
- software
  - All popular services are likely to be available on both Android and iPhone:
    WhatsApp, Go-jek, Grab, Uber, etc.
    - Unless you're in China.
    - Android software
      - is more shitty
        - Java, bloat, no good for realtime audio
        - I bought a Samsung Galaxy Nexus in 2012.
          - Every time I turn wifi on, the phone hangs for a minute.
          - Every time I open Chrome after not using it for a while, the phone hangs for a minute.
      - but more varied because there are more users and developers.
    - Android has more software than iPhone,
      - but unless you have uncommon needs, both Android and iPhone should have the software.
- App store
  - Android: app store regulated by Google but not as heavily as Apple
  - iPhone: app store heavily regulated by Apple
- App store users
  - Android has lots of stupid users giving 1-star to an app for reasons unrelated to the app
  - iPhone users are more willing to pay than Android users

- We need a libre open source phone.

- If you don't update, you have security risk.
** Apple deliberately makes their devices irreparable.
