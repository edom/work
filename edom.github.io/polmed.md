- The role of the media in politics:
    - The media should research/watch/monitor/summarize/audit the government for the public.
    - The media should therefore be owned by the public, and independent of the government. The media should not be funded with tax.
    - The media shapes the public opinion.
    - The media bridges the government and the public.
    - The public doesn't have the time to watch the government.
- The media is the public's opinion of the government.
- The media is whatever the public sees.
    - Shadow/private media: social media, websites, chat groups.
        - "Shadow" in the same sense as "shadow banking".
            - "Shadow" here means unofficial/non-traditional but effective.
        - They may contain hoaxes, fake news, disinformations, and the like.
- How do the public form opinion?
    - Public opinion is country-scale groupthink?
