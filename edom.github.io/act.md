- I rarely watch movies.
- I'm sure there are other good actors, actresses, and movies.
- But I'm not watching all the movies in this world.
- Examples of good acting
    - Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje in "Faster"
    - Christoph Waltz as Hans Landa in "Inglourious Bastards"
    - Heath Ledger as Joker in which Batman movie?
- Examples of good movies
    - films directed by Christopher Nolan
        - "Interstellar"
        - "Inception"
