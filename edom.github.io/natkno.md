- Natural knowledge is knowledge about nature (reality).
- This page lists natural knowledge, sorted descending by verifiability.
- This page tries to teach natural knowledge in the fastest way possible.
    - Knowledge is presented bottom-up.
        - Most verifiable first.
- Truth is a continuum (not binary true-and-false).
- We begin with very wrong ideas.
- As we progress, we become less wrong.
- We might will never be 0% wrong.
    - But knowledge doesn't have to be 100% true in order to be useful.
- Let's go back in time to the early days of physics.
    - We know these are wrong.
        - But we're "cheating": we have hindsight; they didn't.
    - We will revise knowledge as we go.
- Brief excursion to epistemology
    - We *assume* that there are three sources of knowledge:
        - observation (the senses)
        - definition (fiat, agreement between speakers of the same language)
        - inference (logic, rules of thought)
    - We don't need to go deeper into [Philosophy]({% link philo.md %}) for now.
- Define: The *Earth* is where we stand.
- Observe: Things *fall* toward the Earth.
- Observe: Time of fall depends on height only and not mass.
    - [WP:Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo%27s_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa_experiment)
        - Two balls having different weight, dropped from the same height, will reach the Earth at the same time.
- Define: *Velocity* is the rate of change of position.
- Observe: <span>\( h = k \cdot t^2 \)</span> where
    - \\( h \\) is height of fall;
    - \\( t \\) is time of fall;
    - \\( k \\) is a constant.
- Infer: Things fall *with constant acceleration* toward the Earth.
    - How?
- Define: *Glass* is transparent (see-through) solid.
    - [WP:History of glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_glass)
- Observe: A burning leaf stops burning if it's enclosed.
- Observe: Food spoils. Food goes rancid.
- Define: Sundial.
    - [WP:Sundial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial)
    - [WP:Analemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma);
