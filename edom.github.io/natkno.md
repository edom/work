- Overview
    - Target audience:
        - Everyone who wants to justify physics.
        - Everyone who wants to formalize physics.
    - Natural knowledge is knowledge about nature (reality).
    - This page tries to list natural knowledge, sorted descending by verifiability.
    - This page tries to teach natural knowledge in the fastest way possible.
        - Knowledge is presented top-down:
            - A child verifies its parent.
- Brief excursion to philosophy
    - Truth is a continuum (not binary true-and-false).
    - Brief excursion to epistemology
        - We *assume* that there are three sources of knowledge:
            - observation (the senses)
            - definition (fiat, agreement between speakers of the same language)
            - inference (logic, rules of thought)
        - We don't need to go deeper into [Philosophy]({% link philo.md %}) for now.
    - A problem with physics: *too many unjustified tacit assumptions*.
        - Every scientific revolution invalidates some tacit assumptions?
        - Physics is mathematics + engineering + philosophy.
            - If we skip the mathematics, we can't measure.
            - If we skip the engineering, we can't experiment.
            - If we skip the philosophy, we can't progress.
                - We will make unjustified tacit assumptions.

- Let's go back to prehistoric times.
    - Let's begin with very wrong ideas.
        - We're "cheating": we have hindsight; they didn't.
    - We will revise knowledge as we go. We will become less wrong.
    - We might will never be 0% wrong.
        - But knowledge doesn't have to be 100% true in order to be useful.
- Matter
    - Define: *Mass* is the amount of matter.
        - The *mass* of a thing is the amount of matter in that thing.
        - Tacit assumption: Things are made of a finite amount of matter.
            - Water is made of water matter.
            - Iron is made of iron matter.
            - X is made of X matter, etc.
    - Observe:
    If the mass of one copy of X is \\( m \\),
    then the mass of two copies of X is \\( 2 \cdot m \\).
        - What do we mean by a *copy* of X? An "instance" of X?
        - Tacit assumption: Copies of a thing are made of the same kind of matter.
        - Tacit assumption: Things of the same type behave in the same way.
    - Observe: Water dissolves salt.
        - Solution of salt in water?
        - Mixture of water matter and salt matter?

    - How do we know that light *is* an electromagnetic wave?
        - We know that light behaves like an electromagnetic wave, from
            - the speed of light, and
            - the wave behavior of light.
        - But that's all; how do we know that it *is* it?
