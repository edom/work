- Overview
    - Target audience:
        - Everyone who wants to learn physics from first principles.
    - Natural knowledge is knowledge about nature (reality).
    - This page tries to list natural knowledge, sorted descending by verifiability.
    - This page tries to teach natural knowledge in the fastest way possible.
        - Knowledge is presented top-down:
            - A child verifies its parent.
- Brief excursion to philosophy
    - Truth is a continuum (not binary true-and-false).
    - Brief excursion to epistemology
        - We *assume* that there are three sources of knowledge:
            - observation (the senses)
            - definition (fiat, agreement between speakers of the same language)
            - inference (logic, rules of thought)
        - We don't need to go deeper into [Philosophy]({% link philo.md %}) for now.
- Let's go back to prehistoric times.
    - Let's begin with very wrong ideas.
        - We're "cheating": we have hindsight; they didn't.
    - We will revise knowledge as we go. We will become less wrong.
    - We might will never be 0% wrong.
        - But knowledge doesn't have to be 100% true in order to be useful.
- Falling
    - Define: The *Earth* is where we stand.
    - Define: *Duration* is what a timer measures.
    - Define: *Position* is where something is.
    - Define: *Velocity* is the rate of change of position.
    - Define: *Acceleration* is the rate of change of velocity.
    - Define: *Speed* is the magnitude of velocity.
    - Define: *Time* is duration.
    - Define: The *distance* between two points A and B is \\( v \cdot t \\),
        - iff \\( t \\) is the minimum time required by something with constant speed \\( v \\) to go from A to B.
    - Define: *Length* is what a ruler measures.
    - Define: *Acceleration* is the rate of change of velocity.
    - Define: *Weight* is what a weight scale measures.
    - Define: *Mass* is weight.
        - (Pretend that "force" has not been invented.)
    - Infer: Things fall *with constant acceleration* toward the Earth.
        - That is: <span>\( h = k \cdot t^2 \)</span> where
            - \\( h \\) is height of fall;
            - \\( t \\) is time of fall;
            - \\( k \\) is a constant.
        - Observe: Things *fall* toward the Earth.
        - Observe: Time of fall depends on height only and not mass.

    - Observe: Cavendish torsion balance experiment (1797--1798)
        - This experiment finds out the density of the Earth.
