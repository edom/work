- What is a boss?
    1. X is a *boss* of Y iff X can affect Y's salary, even if X does it indirectly.
    1. X is a *strong boss* of Y iff X has the authority to change Y's salary.
    1. X is a *weak boss* of Y iff X is a boss, but not a strong boss, of Y.
- Example:
    - Everyone who can fire you is your strong boss.
    - Everyone who can get you fired (complain to someone who can fire you) is your weak boss.
- The stronger a boss is, the more seriously you should treat him/her.
- Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
