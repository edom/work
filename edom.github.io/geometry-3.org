* Describing curved spaces
- Various ways to describe curved surfaces.
- How do we describe a curved surface?
  - By /functions/ (remember that functions are /mappings/).
  - By /how it differs/ from a reference Euclidean space: by how it is bent.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersurface
** Deformation functions
- By /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(mechanics)][deformation]] functions/.
  - Curved surfaces can be described by a /homeomorphism/ from an Euclidean subspace.
  - A function whose domain is an Euclidean subspace and whose codomain is a curved subspace of that domain.
    - The domain's ambient space is implied from context.

- Understand how to /algebraically/ describe a /curved space/.
  - Example:
    - Consider a circle with origin \(O = (0,0)\) and radius \(r\).
    - Its /analytic-algebraic/ description is \( \SetBuilder{(x,y)}{x^2+y^2=r^2} \).
    - Its /synthetic-algebraic/ description is \( \SetBuilder{x}{d(O,x) = r} \).
- Example ways of describing a circle with origin \(O = (0,0)\) and radius \(r\):
  - /synthetic description/: the set of every point \(x\) where \( d(O,x) = r \).
  - /parametric description/: the set of every coordinate tuple \((x(t),y(t))\) for all \(t \in [0,2\pi]\) where:
    \begin{align*}
    x(t) &= r \cos t
    \\ y(t) &= r \sin t
    \end{align*}
    - See also these Wikipedia articles:
      - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation][parametric equations]]
      - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_surface][parametric surface]]
  - /algebraic description/: the set of every coordinate tuple \((x,y) \in \Real^2\) where
    \begin{align*}
    x^2 + y^2 &= r^2
    \end{align*}
** Surface of revolution
- Understand [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_of_revolution][surfaces of revolution]].
* Conic sections
- history or conic sections, definition of ellipse, parabola, hyperbola; by the angle of intersection
  - [[https://www.etymonline.com/word/ellipse][ellipse]] = fall short, deficit
  - [[https://www.etymonline.com/word/parable][parabola]] = alongside-throw
  - [[https://www.etymonline.com/word/hyperbole][hyperbola]] = over-throw
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola][WP:Parabola]]
  - Put a [[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DoubleCone.png#][double cone]] upright on a table, and intersect it with a plane.
    - Ellipse results if the plane is less steep than the double cone.
    - Parabola results if the plane is parallel to the double cone.
    - Hyperbola results if the plane is more steep than the double cone.
    - An ellipse and a parabola intersect one [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone][cone]] of the double cone.
    - A hyperbola intersect both cones of the double cone.
