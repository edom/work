** Target audience, purpose of this book, and how to read this book
The target audience of this book is myself.

Purpose of the book:
To find the ultimate consequences of mind-related concepts defined in English.
My plan is:
- /Define/ the concepts according to how we use them in everyday English.
- /Infer/ the consequences of those definitions.
- /Relate/ the concepts with each other.
- /Order/ the concepts by requirement (which concepts require which concepts).

Perhaps it should be something like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_concept_analysis][formal concept analysis]]?

How to read this book:
Read anything you want to, but skip the TODOs; those parts are unfinished.
** Fundamental assumptions
/We must agree on these before you read further./
If we don't agree, no communication can happen between us.
I'm not absolutely certain about these assumptions.
I'm happy to change my beliefs if there is a reason for that.
But I don't know how I can communicate without them.

/I assume these axioms./

Objective reality exists.

Logic works.

Every statement has exactly one truth value (somewhere in the continuum between false and true), regardless of whether we know it.

/I assume that these concepts are primitive concepts./
I leave them undefined.
They are like the concept of "point" in geometry.
I don't know how to state them in terms of anything simpler.

want, to want.

belief, to believe.

/I assume these synonyms./

imagination, fantasy.
Imagination comes from Latin.
Fantasy comes from Greek.
Imagination and fantasy have the same meaning.
Imagination doesn't have to be visual, although "imagination" and "image" are related.

knowledge, awareness.
These are the same: to /know/ X, to be /aware/ of X.

attention, focus.
** Ability is the existence of satisfying action.
<2018-11-06>

"S can P" means "There exists an action A such that, after S does A, the statement 'S did P' becomes true."
Example:
"I can boil an egg" means "There is something I can do to make the statement 'I did boil an egg' true".

"S cannot P" means "It is false that S can P".
Thus it means "there is /nothing/ S can do to make 'S did P' true."

Problem: "cannot" is hard to prove, if it's even possible to prove at all.
Example: There are several issues with "I can't jump 10 meters high":
- Am I not able to do that, or do I merely not know how to do that?
  There is a difference between /not being able/ and /not knowing how/.
- Linguistic issue: What does "jump" mean? Must I use my own legs?
- Proving a universal negative: How do I know that there is /nothing/ I can do to make "I jumped 10 meters high" true?

People sometimes say "can't" when they mean "won't".
Example:
"I can't wake up earlier."
Of course he /can/; there is a satisfying action: Go to bed earlier, and put the goddamn phone away from bed.
But he doesn't /want/ to.
He should say "I don't want to wake up earlier."
But /can/ doesn't mean /should/.

People sometimes say "can't" when they mean they don't know how.
Example:
"I can't start the car."
Of course he /can/; there is a satisfying action: Repair the car, turn the key, and so on.
But he doesn't /know/ how.
He should say "I don't know how I can start the car" or "The car isn't starting."
That satisfying action /exists/ regardless of whether he knows it.
** To be animate is to have changing wants.
<2018-11-07>

To be /animate/ is to have changing wants.

To be /inanimate/ is to have unchanging wants.

An /animate/ thing is a thing whose want may change.

Problem: Must the wants change?
Or is it sufficient to have the /possibility/ of changing wants, without having to /actually/ ever change wants?
What is the difference between:
one who can do X but never does X, and
one who really can't do X?

An /inanimate/ thing is a thing whose wants don't change.
That inanimate thing always has that same want.

A thing may want nothing (not want anything).

By "want", I mean "will" or "desire", not "lack".

But how can one want something, if he doesn't lack it?
How can he want something but not lack that thing?
How can he want what he already has?
** "Animate" and "living" are synonyms.
Synonym: An /animate/ thing is a /living/ thing.
A living thing /lives/.
Thus the meaning of "to live" is "to have changing wants".
Thus the meaning of "life" is, literally, "having changing wants".

Problem: this definition generalizes "to live" too much?
** Cause, make, force, control, want, affect
<2018-11-07>

These mean the same:
"to /cause/ X to do Y",
"to /make/ X do Y",
"to /force/ X to do Y".

"Force" suggests, but does not require, that X would otherwise not do Y if X was not forced to.

Examples:
- I made him clean up his room = I forced him to clean up his room = I caused him to clean up his room.
- I kicked the ball = I made the ball move with my foot = I forced my foot on the ball = I caused the ball to move with my foot.
- "I gave birth to my child" approximately means "I forced my child to exist".

These are synonyms:
to affect, to cause to differ, to change, to influence, to make a difference.

To /affect/ is to /change/ (to /make a difference/).

Example:
I kick the ball.
My existence makes a difference to the ball.
The ball moved because I kicked it.
The ball wouldn't move if I didn't kick it.
/I affect the ball./
** To control is to force wants.
<2018-11-07>

X /controls/ Y iff X /forces/ (causes) Y to do what X /wants/ Y to do.

Remember that "to force" means "to cause".

Remember that we assume that /want/ is a primitive concept.
It doesn't assume what can want and what can't want.

We assume that causation is transitive.

Control is transitive, because causation is transitive.
If X controls Y, and Y controls Z, then X controls Z.
The contraposition: If X doesn't control Z, then: X doesn't control Y, or Y doesn't control Z, or both.

We can use that contraposition to find who controls whom in a company.
Example.
Alice, Bob, and Charlie are in the same company.
In the hierarchy, Alice commands Bob, and Bob commands Charlie.
Alice knows Charlie, but never interacts with Charlie.
If Alice tells Bob to make Charlie do what Alice wants Charlie to do, but Charlie doesn't do it, then there are three possibilities:
Alice doesn't control Bob, or Bob doesn't control Charlie, or both.
** TODO "Causal authority"?
To "control" something is to have "causal authority" over it.

The /self/ of X is the maximum extent of the causal authority of X.

"Causal authority" sounds cool. But what does it mean?
* Logic, language, ontology
#+TOC: headlines 2 local
** Philosophers should strive to be understandable.
We should clarify words.
We may generalize words, but we should not redefine words.
We should start from their everyday meaning.

We should avoid inventing a new word if a word already exists for it.

We should use everyday language.
People who bend words too much alienate themselves.
** TODO Reading conditionals
*** TODO (Failed attempt) Properly translating material conditional into English "does not preclude"
Remember that the /material conditional/ \( p \to q \) is equivalent to \( \neg (p \wedge \neg q) \) in classical logic.

We can interpret \( p \wedge \neg q \) as "\( p \) /precludes/ \( q \)".

Thus we can interpret the material conditional \( p \to q \) as "\( p \) /does not preclude/ \( q \)".
However, we practically pretend that it means "if \( p \) then \( q \)".
This lie works because we practically always pick relevant \(p\) and \(q\).

However, there is a difficulty:
If \(p\) and \(q\) are irrelevant, \( p \) is true, and \( q \) is false, then what does "\(p\) does not preclude \(q\)" mean?

See also:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradoxes_of_material_implication
*** TODO Belief inference rule in doxastic logic
We can define \( p \Rightarrow q \) as "knowing \( p \) is sufficient to infer \( q \)", that is, "believing \( p \) implies believing \( q \)".
\[
(p \Rightarrow q) = (K p \rightarrow K q).
\]

But why would we?
** TODO Sameness is meaning-preserving universal substitutability?
<2018-11-06>
/X is the same as Y/ iff every occurence of X can be replaced with Y while preserving the meaning of the containing statement.

What is the relationship between sameness and the principle of the identity of indiscernibles
("there cannot be separate objects or entities that have all their properties in common")?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles
** Interpreting truth value
*** As degree of certainty
Let $\tau(p) \in [0,1]$ describe how /certain/ we are about the sentence $p$.
If $\tau(p) = 0$, then we don't know anything about $p$.
If $\tau(p) = 1$, then we know $p$ for sure.

Note that $\tau(p) = 0$ does /not/ mean that $p$ is false;
it means that we /don't know/.
*** As information transfer, as contagiousness of ascertainment
$\tau(p \to q)$ measures the amount of information transferred from our knowledge of $p$ to our knowledge of $q$.

It measures how reducing the uncertainty of $p$ reduces the uncertainty of $q$.
** Formal logic, interpretation
An interpretation is a mapping from syntax to semantics (meaning).
** TODO Platonism, numbers, ideal existence, and physical existence?
- Isn't this just Plato's theory of forms?
- Do we benefit from talking about this?
- Should we delete this?

"123" is a /decimal representation/ of a number, not the number itself.

A number exists ideally.
It doesn't exist physically.
Our body can't interact with a number.
We can't touch a real number.
There is no physical experiment that tests the properties of numbers.
Our mind can't interact with a number either.
We can't imagine a number.
We can only imagine a /representation/ of that number.

But our minds can correlate idea space and physical space.

We use physics experiments to find out physical laws.
We use thought experiments to find out ideal laws (such as theorems about real numbers).
An eye is a physical sense that enables the brain to probe the space of bodies.
A mind is an ideal sense that enables the brain to probe the space of ideas.

*** Mess 1
- Let's study a /propositional calculus/, a formal language.

  - It's important because we're going to build other formal languages on it.
  - A "calculus" is a set of rules.

    - What is the "calculus" in "propositional calculus"?

      - [[https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Calculus][EOM:Calculus]]

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus][WP:Propositional calculus]]

- A /language/ has /syntax/ (form) and /semantics/ (meaning).
- A /formal language/ describes a set of strings by using an /alphabet/ and some /formation rules/.

  - The alphabet is the set of symbols that can be in the strings.
  - The formation rules decide which strings are in the language.

- A /formula/ is a string in the language.
- For a propositional calculus:

  - The alphabet is:

    - the set of these five blackboard-bold /logical symbols/:

      - $\bbN$ (negation, "not"),
      - $\bbC$ (conjunction, "and"),
      - $\bbD$ (disjunction, "or"),
      - the left parenthesis,
      - and the right parenthesis;

    - plus a set of /non-logical symbols/:

      - Anything can be non-logical symbols as long as it isn't already a logical symbol.
      - Usually a non-logical symbol is a Latin capital letter,

        - but we don't have to restrict ourselves to one letter per symbol.

          - We can freely decide that a symbol can be one word, or even a phrase.

            - It may even be outside the Latin alphabet.
            - It might be a Chinese character, or an emoticon, or a drawing.

  - The formation rules are:

    1. Every non-logical symbol alone is a formula.
    2. If $\alpha$ is a formula,
       then $(\bbN ~ \alpha)$ ("not $\alpha$") is a formula.
    3. If $\alpha$ is a formula and $\beta$ is a formula,
       then $(\bbC ~ \alpha ~ \beta)$ ("$\alpha$ and $\beta$") is a formula.
    4. If $\alpha$ is a formula and $\beta$ is a formula,
       then $(\bbD ~ \alpha ~ \beta)$ ("$\alpha$ or $\beta$") is a formula.

  - Examples for propositional calculus:

    - An example formula is $(\bbC ~ X ~ Y)$.
    - An example of a string that is /not/ a formula is $\bbC ~ X ~ Y$ because it lacks the parentheses.

  - (Note to self)

    - We should be less formal.
    - We should teach the formation rules by example.
    - We should use standard symbols $\neg, \wedge, \vee$.
    - Should we use $\&$ instead of $\wedge$?

      - Do $\wedge$ and $\vee$ confuse newcomers?

- Now that we are familiar with the syntax of propositional calculus,
  we can move on to a /predicate calculus/.

  - To the logical symbols, we add two /quantifier/ symbols:

    - $\forall$ ("for all", universal quantifier),
    - $\exists$ ("there exists", existential quantifier).

  - Every capital letter in italic font is called a /relation symbol/.
    Every relation symbol has an /arity/ that is a natural number;
    the arity is the number of parameters taken by the relation symbol.
    If the arity is zero, the relation symbol is also called a /constant symbol/.
  - The non-logical symbols of a predicate calculus is a set of relation symbols;
    each relation symbol looks like $A^n$ where $n$ is the symbol's /arity/;
    it is the number of arguments.

    - For example, we can define a predicate calculus whose set of relation symbols is $\{ E^2 \}$.

      - An example formula is then $E(x,y)$.
      - An example sentence is then $\forall x ~ E(x,x)$.

  - We call a predicate calculus has order one iff the quantifiers can only take constant symbols.
  - To the formation rules, we add:

    1. if $\rho^n$ is a relation symbol of arity $n$,
       and $\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n$ are variables, then $(\rho^n \alpha_1 \ldots \alpha_n)$ is a formula;
    2. if $\rho^0$ is a relation symbol of arity zero, then $\rho^0$ is a formula;
    3. if $\alpha$ is a formula and $\beta$ is a formula, then $(\bbC \alpha \beta)$ is a formula.
    4. if $v$ is a variable, $Q$ is a quantifier, and $F$ is a formula, then $(Q v ~ F)$ is a formula.

  - A /sentence/ is something that can be given a truth value;
    in propositional calculus, it is a formula;
    in first-order predicate calculus, it is a formula with no free variables.
    An example of a first-order predicate calculus sentence is $\forall x : E(x,x)$.
    An example of a first-order predicate calculus formula that is not a sentence is $E(x,x)$.
  - An /interpretation/ of a language is a function
    that takes a sentence of that language and gives a /truth value/.
    For example, if we have a graph,
    then we may map every term $x$ to a vertex $I(x)$ of the graph,
    and we may map the formula $R(x,y)$
    $I(R(x,y))$, that is whether $(I(x), I(y))$ is an edge of the graph.

\begin{align*}
I(R(x,y)) = E(I(x),I(y))
\end{align*}

- How many truth values are there?

  - It depends on the logic.
  - In classical logic,
    there are /two/ truth values: /false/ and /true/.
  - In SQL (a language used to interact with relational databases),
    there are /three/ truth values: /false/, /null/, and /true/.
  - In the IEEE 1164 standard, part of VHDL (a language for describing electronic circuits),
    there are /nine/ truth values.
  - In fuzzy logic, there are as many truth values as there are real numbers in $[0,1]$.
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-valued_logic][WP:Four-valued logic]]
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1164][WP:IEEE 1164]]

- A /metalanguage/ is a language that describes a language.

  - We used English as a metalanguage to describe propositional calculus.

Now we formalize.
Let $L$ be a language,
let $F$ be the set of formulas of $L$,
and let $T$ be the set of truth values of this interpretation.
Let $T = (\{0,1\},\neg,\wedge,\vee)$ be a /Boolean algebra/.
(???)

An /interpretation/ of a language $L$
is a function $I : F \to T$.
This function must satisfy
$I((\bbN x)) = \neg I(x)$,
and $I((\bbC x y)) = I(x) \wedge I(y)$,
and $I((\bbD x y)) = I(x) \vee I(y)$.

For example, $\{ x, y \}$ is a model of $x$.

For example, \( \{ x, y, (\bbC x y) \} \models (\bbC x y) \).

For example, $\{ (\bbC x y) \}$ is /not/ an interpretation of $L$,
because if $(\bbC x y)$ is in $I$,
then both $x$ and $y$ must also be in $I$.

We say that $I$ /models/ $p$ or $I$ is a /model/ of $P$,
written $I \models p$,
iff $I(p)$ is true.
We say that $p$ is /satisfiable/ iff $p$ /has a model/, that is, iff there exists $I$ such that $I \models p$.
The symbol $\models$ is called a "double turnstile".
Why do we bother inventing another notation ($\models$) for a notation that already exists ($\in$)?

For example, we may choose to map $x$ to "true" and everything else to "false".

- Extensions of first-order logic:

  - modal logic

Given the formation rules of a language, we can
(1) /generate/ all formulas
(2) /decide/ whether a given string is a formula.

- The logics form a hierarchy.

  - propositional logic
  - first-order logic
  - second-order logic

This first-order language can describe itself,
where $L(\alpha)$ is true iff $\alpha$ is a string that is a Latin small letter alone:
\begin{align*}
\forall \alpha : L(\alpha) &\implies W(\alpha)
\\ \forall \alpha : \forall \beta : W(\alpha) &\implies W((N \alpha))
\\ \forall \alpha : \forall \beta : W(\alpha) \wedge W(\beta) &\implies W((C \alpha \beta))
\\ \forall \alpha : \forall \beta : W(\alpha) \wedge W(\beta) &\implies W((D \alpha \beta))
\end{align*}
and that can also be written using sequent calculus notation
with implicit universal quantification over free variables:
\begin{align*}
L(\alpha) &\vdash W(\alpha)
\\ W(\alpha) &\vdash W((N \alpha))
\\ W(\alpha), W(\beta) &\vdash W((C \alpha \beta))
\\ W(\alpha), W(\beta) &\vdash W((D \alpha \beta))
\end{align*}

*** Mess 2
In propositional logic, it takes at most $O(n)$ steps to determine whether a string of length $n$ is a formula.

A /variable/ is any of the 26 Latin small letters from $a$ to $z$.

In /propositional logic/, we represent a sentence with a letter.
For example, we can use the letter $p$ to represent "John is lecturing"
and the letter $q$ to represent "John is awake".
From those two sentences, we can construct another sentence $p \to q$
that represents "If John is lecturing, then John is awake".

A /logical system/ (a "logic") is a /formal system/ and an /interpretation/.
A formal system has a /syntax/ and some /inference rules/.
The syntax tells us how to form /formulas/.
A syntax is a set of rules that determine which strings are formulas.
The inference rules tell us how we can rewrite a formula to another formula
while preserving the truth of the formula.
A formula has no inherent meaning,
but we can give meaning to it by defining an /interpretation/.
An /interpretation/ maps a formal system to a /model/.

A /sentence/ is a formula with no free variables.
A /formula/ is a statement whose truth can be determined, that is either true or false.
For example, "John is lecturing" and $1+1 = 2$ are statements.
Later we will see that there are other ways of defining "truth".

A /signature/ $\sigma$ is a triple of
a set of relation symbols,
a set of function symbols,
and an arity function.
A /structure/ $\struc{A}$ is a triple $(A,\sigma,I)$ where $A$ is a domain,
$\sigma$ is a signature, and $I$ is an /interpretation function/.

A formal argument is an argument that is made by blindly following the rules,
by mechanically following the rules to manipulate symbols,
without any meaning, without any guesswork.
This allows computers to help us.

Here we will review mathematical logic and model theory.

Mathematical logic allows us to represent English in symbols without ambiguity.
Logic also works with other human languages, not only English.

A key idea in logic is the separation between /form/ and /meaning/.
The validity of an argument depends only on its form?

Every argument of this form (modus ponens) is valid:
\begin{align*}
p, ~ p \to q \vdash q
\end{align*}

Abductive reasoning (physics?):

\begin{align*}
p, ~ q \vdash_? p \to q
\end{align*}

In classical deductive logic, there is only one way to reach valid conclusion:
by valid premises and valid argument.
There are three ways to arrive at an invalid conclusion: - by invalid premises but valid argument, - by valid premises but invalid argument, - by invalid premises and invalid argument.

In logic, an interpretation assigns truth value to well-formed formulas.

A system is /sound/ iff every provable sentence is true: $A \vdash B \implies A \models B$.

A system is /complete/ iff every true sentence is provable $A \models B \implies A \vdash B$.

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Formal_Logic/Predicate_Logic/Satisfaction

/Intended interpretation/ is synonym for /standard model/.

We use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression][s-expressions]] to simplify parsing.

Greek letters are part of the /metalanguage/ (the language describing the /object language/).

Example term: $(A (A a b) (N c))$.
**** Interpretation
An /interpretation/ is a function that takes a term.

Example interpretation:

\begin{align*}
I(a) &= 1
\\
I(b) &= 1
\\
I(c) &= 0
\\
I((A \alpha \beta)) &= I(\alpha) \wedge I(\beta) = \min(I(\alpha),I(\beta))
\\
I((N \alpha)) &= \neg I(\alpha) = 1 - I(\alpha)
\end{align*}

where $0$ means "false" and $1$ means "true".

Applying the rules recursively to the example term gives

\begin{align*}
I((A(Aab)(Nc))) &= I((Aab)) \wedge I((Nc))
\\ &= (I(a) \wedge I(b)) \wedge I((Nc))
\\ &= (1 \wedge I(b)) \wedge I((Nc))
\\ &= (1 \wedge 1) \wedge I((Nc))
\\ &= 1 \wedge I((Nc))
\\ &= 1 \wedge \neg I(c)
\\ &= 1 \wedge \neg 0
\\ &= 1 \wedge 1
\\ &= 1.

- First-order probability logic (FOPL) shares the same syntax as first-order logic (FOL), but different interpretation:

  - FOL interpretation maps FOL wff to truth value $\{0,1\}$.
  - FOPL interpretation maps FOL wff to probability $[0,1]$.

- Boolean algebra is a special case of fuzzy logic?

  - Replace $\\{0,1\\}$ (the set of Boolean values) with $[0,1]$ (the set of real numbers in the unit line).

\end{align*}

  - What should $t(p \to q)$ be?

Classical logic:

\begin{align*}
t(p \to q) &= t(\neg p \vee q) = \max(1 - t(p), t(q))
\end{align*}

Bayesian:

\begin{align*}
t(p \to q) &= t(q|p) = \frac{t(q \wedge p)}{t(p)}
\end{align*}

Induction:

\begin{align*}
\exists a (p(a) \wedge q(a)) \vdash_i \forall x (p(x) \wedge q(x))
\\
T(p) \subseteq T(q) \vdash_i \forall x (p(x) \implies q(x))
\\
T(p) = \{ x ~|~ p(x) \}

* Science, engineering, and technology
** Science is knowledge.
Science is the application of hypothetico-deductive scientific method?

/Science aims to find what each inanimate thing wants./

Remember that we assume that /want/ is a primitive concept.
It doesn't assume what can want and what can't want.

What an /inanimate/ thing /wants/ is what it would do if it weren't /forced/ to.
Thus we can find what an inanimate thing want by /isolating/ it so that nothing forces it to do anything.

Example.
Imagine a weight balance.
I put a heavier weight on the left plate.
I put a lighter weight on the right plate.
Both weights /want/ to fall toward the Earth.
The heavier weight /forces/ the lighter weight to rise,
against what the lighter weight /wants/,
against what the lighter weight would do if the heavier weight did not force the lighter weight to rise.

/Science aims to find what each inanimate thing wants./
We isolate inanimate things, so that nothing control them, so that we know how they behave.
We isolate atoms so that we can understand their wants.

Nature /wants/ to enforce the law of nature.

A gas /wants/ to fill its container?

We aren't personifying inanimate things.
They do /want/ something.
It's just that their wants don't change with time.

Every mass /wants/ to attract every other mass.
Earth /wants/ a rock to fall toward the Earth.

What does a voltage regulator want?

There is a difference between these statements:
- Every thing that does not exist wants to continue not-existing.
- Nothing wants to continue not-existing.
*** Problem: How do we know that nothing is forcing an inanimate thing to do anything?
Difference of meaning:
- "Nothing" exists = the English word "nothing" exists
- Nothing exists = there does not exist anything; it is not true that anything exists

Which one does "Nothing causes its own existence" mean?
- There isn't anything that causes its own existence.
- There is a thing that we call "nothing", and it causes its own existence.

Can something cause its own existence?
Can something causes itself to exist?
Is there such a thing?

Is there something forcing everything else to exist?

Is everything forced to exist?
Does anything want to exist?

If we assume that something cannot cause its own existence,
then everything must have a cause that is not itself.
Thus there is something /forcing/ everything else to /exist/.

If I don't exist, how can I force myself to exist?
*** What is science?

* Cause, causality, implication, and probability
** Cause
"C /causes/ E" means:
- C /precedes/ E: C happens before E.
- C is /necessary/ for E: If C doesn't happen, then E doesn't happen.
- C is /sufficient/ for E: If C happens, then E happens.

Synonyms: to cause, to determine, to ascertain.

A /causal factor/ is not a cause.
** Example of updating a causal model: fire, match, and dryness
At first, we believe that Strike causes Fire.

But then we find water.

Now we believe that Strike /and/ Dry causes Fire.
Note the verb "causes":
"Strike and Dry" is one thing, not two separate "Strike" and "Dry".
Strike alone or Dry alone doesn't cause Fire.

But then we find chemistry and vacuum pump.

Now we believe that Strike and Dry and Oyygen causes Fire, and so on.

When we encounter a surprise, we update our /causal model/.

"The essence of causality is the generation and determination of one phenomenon by another."
https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/spirkin/works/dialectical-materialism/ch02-s06.html
- That is all that page has to say.
- That page should have been a sentence instead.
** Causality jargon
Suppose that there are a button X, a button Y, and a lamp Z,
wired such that Z lights up iff both X and Y are pressed.

Does pressing X cause Z to light up?
No, but it /contributes/.
It is a /causal factor/.
Pressing X is /necessary/, but not /sufficient/, for lighting up Z.

The cause of Z's lighting up is /both/ pressing X and pressing Y.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_and_ultimate_causation
- The "causal model" Wikipedia article summarizes some of Judea Pearl's work. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_model
** Conditional is not causation.
Suppose:
- L1 lights up iff B1 is pressed.
- L2 lights up iff B2 is pressed.
- L3 lights up iff B1 is pressed and B2 is pressed.

Then "if L1 and L2 light up, then L3 lights up" is a true conditional statement,
but "both L1 and L2 light up" is not the cause of "L3 lights up".

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality#Contrasted_with_conditionals
** Causation is not transitive.
See the section "3.1. Counterexamples to Transitivity" in the 2017 article "The Transitivity and Asymmetry of Actual Causation".
https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ergo/12405314.0004.001/--transitivity-and-asymmetry-of-actual-causation?rgn=main;view=fulltext
** Causation increases conditional probability
Suppose that C causes E.

Then P(E|C) exceeds P(E).

What does this mean: "C gives us some information about E"?

The converse isn't always true.

"Causality connotes lawlike necessity, whereas probabilities connote exceptionality, doubt, and lack of regularity"
(Pearl 2009 Causality book p. 1).
** Suspecting causation from correlation of things that happen almost together
Let C abbreviate Cause.

Let E abbreviate Effect.

"C and E correlate" means that "E happens if C happens, and E doesn't happen if C doesn't happen".

"Immediate" means "within short duration".

If we often see C happen /immediately before/ E,
and we often see C and E /correlate/,
then we may come to /believe/ that C /causes/ E.
To justify this, we tacitly assume that /not much/ can happen in such short duration;
we assume that the /immediate future/ is predictable.
We assume the short duration between C and E makes
it improbable for anything else to /confound/ the way C causes E.
The shorter the duration, the more improbable confounding is.

Consider two drugs: S (Slow) and F (Fast).
Suppose that, in reality,
F makes the person vomit after 1 hour,
and S makes the person vomit after 1 year,
but we don't know those yet.
It is easier for us to see (and conclude) that F causes vomiting than to see that S causes vomiting,
because there are much fewer things that can make the person vomit in 1 hour than in 1 year.

Thus we may define /duration/ as /maximum number of possible events/.
There are more things that may happen in 2 seconds than in 1 second.
What does it mean for something to /happen/?

We may /believe/ that C causes E, but does C /really/ cause E?

I strike a match head.
Then it ignites.

I do that three times with other match heads, and find the same thing.

Thus I generalize: Striking a match head /causes/ its ignition.

Modern physics can explicate the /chain/ of causes (I may mistake the details).
Friction /causes/ the the heating of the stricken part of the match head.
The heat and oxygen /causes/ the ignition of the stricken part.
The ignition /causes/ more conversion of chemical bonds into heat.
The additional heat /causes/ a chain reaction that spreads the flame into nearby unlit parts.

I wet a match head with drinking water.
I strike it.
It doesn't ignite.
I infer that the wetness causes the match head to fail to ignite.
What justifies my inference?

What was causality to early humans?

Can a Hebbian learner learn causality?
** Counterfactual reasoning
/We justify some counterfactuals by frequentist probability./
Suppose that a driver died in a car crash.
We assume that the driver would not have died if the car had not crashed.
Frequentist probability justifies that assumption.
There are many enough car crashes.
We have the statistics.

/We don't know about other counterfactuals./
We don't know what would happen if Hitler won World War 2.
We don't know any way of repeating World War 2 many times.
- How do we justify statements like "If Hitler had never been made a Chancellor, then World War 2 would have never happened."?
  - If Hitler hadn't done it, wouldn't someone else have?
  - If Hitler hadn't done it, wouldn't there be someone else more evil?

What /encumbers reasoning/ is the /multitude of probable causes/, not the /unrepeatability/ of the event.

When reasoning counterfactually, we tacitly assume that /the law of nature doesn't change/.
- We assume that the law of nature is the same 1,000 years ago.
  - It seems that any attempt at justifying this would crash into Hume's induction problem.
    - The law of nature is the same yesterday.
    - The law of nature is the same two days ago.
    - The law of nature has always been the same?
      - We don't know the law of nature before the Big Bang.
    - However, for most practical purposes, the law of nature has always been the same.

* Model and simplification
#+TOC: headlines 2 local
** Summary
A /model/ of a thing is a /simplification/ of that thing.

A model always comes with /simplifying assumptions/.

** The meaning of "model"
*** History of the English word "model"
In the 15th century, a model is a small woodwork crafted with the same proportions of a building that is going to be built.
Thus a model has the same shape of the building but is much smaller.
For example, if the building has a stone wall, then the model has a wooden card.

The English word "model" comes from Latin "modellus" that is diminutive of "modulus" that is diminutive of "modus".
The Latin "modus" means "measure", and "modulus" is small "modus", and "modellus" is small "modulus";
thus "modellus" should mean "a small small measure".

The "model" in "bone remodeling" and "kitchen remodeling" means reshaping, reformation, renewal, renovation, replacement.

  - Historical Thesaurus of English (ht.ac.uk):
    The noun "model" was used in 1575 to mean "plans of construction".

*** The meanings of "model" in 2018
How do we show that all these senses of "model" are essentially simplifications?
**** Concretization for transfer learning
For example, we study a /model organism/ to understand other organisms.
This suggests that a model is about /transfer learning/:
knowledge about the model maps to knowledge about the modeled,
as long as the knowledge is about aspects captured by the model.
See also the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism][Wikipedia article about model organism]].
**** Abstraction, picking aspects, ignoring irrelevant details
- A Newton equation system /models/ a real physical system.
- A Newton equation system /is a model of/ a real physical system.
- Quadratic equations /model/ parabolic motions.
- The Lotka-Volterra equations can /model/ the populations of lions and deers in a savanna.

It is confusing that "model" can mean both concretion and abstraction, which are opposites.
**** A resemblance that takes less effort to make than the real thing does
- This /model/ railroad is mostly made of plastic.
- This miniature /models/ the 20-story building.
- This miniature /is a model of/ the 20-story building.
- A stick figure is a /model/ of a person/animal/being.
**** Intentional resemblance
- Some cartoon characters /are modeled after/ real people.
- The Abraham Lincoln statue /was modeled after/ Abraham Lincoln.
  (It means that the statue was intended to look like him.)
**** Fashion model, photo model, actor
- The /model/ sits on the chair so that the painters can begin painting.
- The /model/ wearing a fancy dress walks on the catwalk.
- The /model/ is posing for the camera.
- His dog is /modeling/ for a dog food advertisement.
**** What one strives to imitate
- He is a /role model/.
- He is a /model/ husband. He and his wife are much happier after their marriage.
**** Type, class, kind, variant, product line
- Ford /Model/ T and Tesla /Model/ S are cars.
- This Honda car comes in two /models/: an automatic transmission /model/ and a manual transmission /model/.
- Which /model/ of this Toyota car do you want to buy: the gasoline engine /model/ or the diesel engine /model/?
** Modeling is simplification.
Here we think of some examples where X is a model of Y.
We discuss about (1) how X simplifies Y (the "manner of simplification"), (2) what the simplifying assumptions are,
and (3) what nonsense happens when the assumptions are violated.

The following paragraphs follow this pattern: "X models Y, by /(manner of simplification)/, assuming /(simplifying assumptions)/".

The formula \(q \to r\) models the formula \((p\wedge q) \to r\), by grounding some variables, assuming that \(p\) is true.

The formula \(e^x \approx 1 + x + x^2/2\) models the formula \(e^x = \sum_{k=0}^\infty x^k/k!\), by truncating the series, assuming that \(x\) is near zero.

The statement "if I strike the match then it will burn" is a causal /model/ of how striking matches work in reality, by picking a small part of the modeled,
assuming that all matches are dry (and many other implicit simplifying assumptions we take for granted).

A fashion model models the average person, by hasty generalization, assuming that the average person has similar body measurements.
(Fallacies such as hasty generalization can be useful. Indeed a model is something /wrong but useful/.)
Violating this assumption makes the clothes misfit.

The tuple (john, 30 years old) models the tuple (john, 30 years old, black hair, brown eyes),
by projection (as in the geometric projection of a solid to its shadow),
assuming that the discarded aspects are irrelevant.
Modeling is dimension reduction.
Modeling is projection.

If we violate a simplifying assumption, the model breaks down and gives nonsensical results.
The name-age tuple (john, 10000 years old) models something nonexistent.
We can insert such nonsensical data into the database, but what does such nonsensical data mean?
We can substitute the mass variables in Newton's gravity equation with negative quantities, but what does it mean?

Our perception models reality, assuming that we stay in the environment that evolution and natural selection led us to.
We violate this assumption when we fly an aircraft.
This violation may kill us.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_illusions_in_aviation
- https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/did-humans-evolve-to-see-things-as-they-really-are/
  - "Mimicry works only if there is an objective reality to mimic."
** Modeling by ignoring irrelevant information
"To model X" is to ignore the irrelevant aspects of X.

"X models Y" means "Y is X with some simplifying assumptions".

"X models Y" means "Y is X with some details lost".

Example of how model ignores irrelevant aspects.
Statics.
Real physical systems in rest.
Pick a coordinate system.
Center of mass of car.
Change car color.
The model is the same.
The reality is different.
The model ignores the irrelevant aspect that is the car's color.
** How we model things
We model a thing by making simplifying assumptions on that thing.
We choose which aspects to care about.
We ignore all other aspects.
Thus a model of something is a /simplification/ of that thing.

We judge models by their usefulness, not by their correctness.
*** Modeling by partial evaluation (grounding of variables)
An example of how to model is partial evaluation (grounding of variables).
In this case, the model X is obtained from the modeled Y by partially evaluating Y, that is, by assuming the constancy of some variables in Y.
*** TODO Capturing function?
We say any of these to mean the same thing:

- "The set X models the set Y with capturing function f."
- "The function f models Y with X."

The meaning is "There are subsets $X' \subseteq X$ and $Y' \subseteq Y$
such that $f : Y' \to X'$ is surjective."

The "capturing function" defines the aspects of reality that we capture in our model.
The function describes how X model Y.

Corollary: Every set models itself.
This is the theoretically correct but practically useless 1:1 map.

Here are some examples of "X models Y" to show the generality of that definition:

In software engineering, we can map Y (an employee) to X (a row in the database), but then we lose some irrelevant information about Y, such as hair color, weight.

In physics, we can map Y (a real physical system) to X (a Newton equation system) by assuming certain things (coordinate systems, point masses, absolute time),
but we can't map X to Y because in reality there are no point masses and time is relative.
By "Newton equation system", we mean a system of equations whose every equation looks like $F_k = m_k \cdot a_k$.

In geometry, we can map Y (a 3D vector) to X (a 2D vector).
Thus geometric projection is modeling.

In analysis, we can map Y (the exponential function) to X (a truncated Taylor series of the exponential function).
Thus approximation is modeling.

In real life, a writing is a model of its author.
What you think about X is your model of X.
Everyone models everyone they have ever encountered.
Our thoughts model reality.
Brain activity models reality.
Our thoughts of ourselves model ourselves.

Consider X = the set of all white cars and Y = the set of all cars.
Obviously X is a subset of Y.
X models Y.
*** TODO Modeling (approximation) by truncation
*** TODO Modeling by formula truncation
We truncate \( (p \wedge q) \to r \) to \( p \to r \), but not to \( p \), and not to \( r \).
We truncate \( p \wedge q \) to \( p \).
We truncate \( p \vee q \) to \( q \).
- \( M \) models \( M \wedge F \).
- \( M \) models \( M \vee F \).
- If \( M \) models \( R \), then \( M \to C \) models \( R \to C \).
*** TODO Modeling by series truncation
This requires that the series converge.

** Fundamental learning by falsifying simplifying assumptions
We learn something fundamental by testing ("torturing") our models at their limits to break them.
We can find out a model's simplifying assumptions by pushing it to failure.
Fundamental learning happens at the boundary of a simplifying assumption,
that is, a situation where a simplifying assumption changes from true to false.
This is what experimental physicists do.

We learn about people when we anger them.
Other people's anger signals us that at least one of our simplifying assumptions about them doesn't hold.

An aircraft crash signals that a simplifying assumption, of someone, somewhere, is wrong.
** Generalizing the "model" in model theory?
Sentence S models sentence T iff S can be derived from T by grounding some variables.
The simplifying assumption is that assignment of variables to ground terms.
The simplifying assumption is an interpretation.

Examples.
"John ate a hamburger" is a model of "X ate Y".
"John ate a hamburger" is a model of "Someone ate something".

To /interpret/ a sentence is to /ground/ all its variables (to substitute all its variables with /ground terms/).

This generalizes model theory?
** We model things because our thought is limited
We /model/ a machine in order to /understand/ what it does:
to /interpret/ what it does, to give /meaning/ to what it does.
Of course what we /think/ it does is not what it /actually/ does.
We think the machine is adding two numbers.
What the machine actually does is shuffling electrons around in a way that we interpret as adding two numbers.
We model something so that we can reason about it.
We can only think about very few things at once.

We ignore hardware problems, such as unreliable power supplies, cosmic rays flipping bits,
cats pissing on the machine, fires burning down the building,
and other infinitely many hardware problems we conveniently ignore.
The simplifying assumption is that the hardware works in the environment it's designed for.
As long as our simplifying assumptions hold, our model is valid.

We need that model.
Without model, irrelevant details would preclude us from understanding anything.
** A model is ...
A model is ... resemblance, replica, downscaling, simplification?
We say "X models Y" iff X resembles Y, iff X behaves like Y, iff X is a simplification of Y, iff X and Y have something in common but X is simpler than Y?
A model of X is a simplified representation of X.
A model is a simplified description of reality?
A description of reality is not reality.
If reality and theory disagree, then reality wins and theory must change.
** Model and reality
- Some models model reality well.
- Some reality is modeled well.
- Some models are unrealistic.
- Some reality are unmodelable.
** Modeling: How does X model Y?
Consider several ways we can model a person:

- as a stick figure
- as a photograph
- as a police sketch
- as a tuple (row in a relational database)
- as a "chemical" that may react with another person ("chemical")

What is a "model" in model theory?
Here I try to paraphrase
the 2000 David Marker book "Introduction to Model Theory" [[http://library.msri.org/books/Book39/files/marker.pdf][pdf]]
and the 2000 Weiss--D'Mello book "Fundamentals of Model Theory" [[http://www.math.toronto.edu/weiss/model_theory.pdf][pdf]].
I may err.
My paraphrase:

- A /structure/ of a formal language $L$ is a pair $(A,I)$, where $A$ is a set called the /universe/,
  and $I$ is the structure's /interpretation function/.
  Such structure must also satisfy these:

  - Every constant symbol $c \in L$ maps to a universe element $I(c) \in A$.
  - Every relation symbol $R \in L$ maps to a relation $I(R) \subseteq A^n$, with the same arity $n$.
  - Every function symbol in $F \in L$ maps to a function $I(F) : A^n \to A$, with the same arity $n$.
    Note that a function of arity $n$ is a kind of relation with arity $n + 1$.
    See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity][WP:Arity]].

- Structure $A$ /models/ sentence $\varphi$, written $A \models \varphi$, iff ... ?
- I think I forget something.
  Read Chapter 0 of the book.
  It has examples.

The codomain of the interpretation function $I : L \to J(A)$ is defined as follows.

- Every element of $A$ is also in $J(A)$.
- Every function $F : A^n \to A$ is also in $J(A)$, for every $n$ that makes sense.
- Every relation $R \subseteq A^n$ is also in $J(A)$, for every $n$ that makes sense.
  (This makes the previous bullet point redundant.)
- That's all.

In other words:
$$
J(A) = A + 2^{A^0} + 2^{A^1} + \ldots + 2^{A^n} + \ldots
$$

I think $J(A)$ is related to a Herbrand universe, but how?

The structure $S = (A,I)$ maps the language $L$ to $J(A)$.

** Model of model: multiple-level machine model
A model can model another model.
We can stack simplifying assumptions on top of other simplifying assumptions.

A mechanical machine is modeled by a system of equations derived from Newton's motion laws.

We can model an abacus ...

Suppose that we have a mechanical calculator that adds two 3-digit numbers.
Suppose that we have an electronic calculator that also adds two 3-digit numbers.
Then /the same model/ models both the mechanical calculator and the electronic calculator.

An electrical machine is called a "circuit".

First, we can model a circuit as its /lumped element model/.
This model is a system of equations derived from Kirchhoff's circuit laws.
This model is only valid under the conditions described in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumped_element_model#Lumped_matter_discipline][WP:Lumped matter discipline]].

A /switch/ S is modeled as a /lumped component/ S1 with one binary state (open/closed) and two terminals (S1A and S1B).

Second, we can model the lumped element model S1 further as Boolean algebra equation.
The switch model S1 is then modeled again as a /Boolean-algebra equation/ S2: S1A = S1B.

An electrical logic /circuit/ is modeled as a /system/ of Boolean-algebra equations.

An electrical logic circuit /component/ is modeled as an /equation/ in Boolean-algebra.

An electrical logic circuit /node/ is modeled as a /variable/ that holds either 0 or 1.

A computing machine is called a "computer".

A computer is modeled by... not a system of equations?

** Complexity
Here we try to understand complexity from its etymology.
The following etymology is according to the Wiktionary entries on [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/simple#Etymology][simple]], [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/complex#Etymology][complex]], [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/plico#Etymology_2][plico]], [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/plecto#Etymology_1][plecto]], [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/complicate#Etymology][complicate]], [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/complect#Etymology][complect]].

"Simple" comes from Latin "simplex" (one-fold), from "sim-" (same) and "plicare" (to fold, to bend),
comparable with "multiple" (many-fold), "uniplex" (one-fold), "duplex" (two-fold), "triplex" (three-fold), and so on.
"Complex" comes from Latin "com-" (together) and "plectere" (to weave, to braid, to twist), comparable with "complect", "complicate".
"Plicare" and "plectere" both come from a Proto-Indo-European word meaning "to fold, to weave".
(I omit this PIE word because I don't know how to type it in XeLaTeX; copying doesn't work.)

Thus "simple" means "one-fold" and "complex" means "woven together".

Here we try to understand complexity by an example of paper folding.

Imagine a sheet of paper.
Fold it several times.

The /complexity/ of the resulting shape is the number of folds, that is how many times the original sheet is folded.
The shape with zero complexity is the original sheet of paper before any folding.

A shape's complexity is unique and irreducible.
An \(n\)-fold shape can only be made by folding exactly \(n\) times, no less and no more, if we assume that papers don't crease when folded.

A fold affects all folds after it.
The folding order matters.
The folds usually don't commute.

A fold always adds complexity.
There is no way to unfold a folded paper by folding it.
A combination of folds will never be equal to an unfold.

See also the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami][Wikipedia entry on origami]] (paper folding).

Folding /complicates/ the shape.
Unfolding /simplifies/ the shape.

We can /simplify/ a shape by removing its last folds.
Suppose that a shape is a folding sequence (a sequence of folds).
Then shape X is a /simplification/ of shape Y iff the folding sequence X begins (is a prefix of) the folding sequence Y.

** Tools, usage, and machine
Remember that we defined /self/ as everything that we control.

The essence of tools is the extension of self (the boundary of control).

A /tool/ is a thing that extends our /self/ (our boundary of control).
A tool is a thing that enables us to control more things than we would without that tool.

"Tool" is a relative concept, like "weed", "good", "bad".
Whether something is a tool depends on what use we imagine of it.
We can think of a rock as a useless heavy space-occupying thing.
We can think of a rock as a tool for crushing things.
To 20th century people, a computer is a mind extension tool.
To a villager in the Stone Age, a computer might be a heavy weight that can be thrown to kill animals.

/Usage is goal-directed control/.
To use something is to control it for a goal/purpose/intention.
"To use X for Y" is to control X in order to achieve Y (to make Y true).

A tool is something we use.

A tool may be animate.

People are tools.
Everyone uses everyone else.
We use each other.
A worker is a capitalist's tool; a capitalist is also a worker's tool.
An employee is his employer's tool; an employer is also his employee's tool.
Surely employers avoid hiring useless employees, and employees avoid hiring useless employers.
A useless employee doesn't work; a useless employer doesn't pay.

How /do/ we use this person?
How /can/ we use this person?
What /does/ this person help us do?
What /can/ this person help us do?

Using other people is not inherently bad.
One can use his tools with care, whether animate and inanimate.
But this idea may discomfort non-philosophers.

It is only a matter of time before a tool-using animal realizes that it can use other animals as tools.

Are we using others, or are we being used by others?
** Tools and machines
(I need to find the words to say this, and rewrite this more clearly.)

A /machine/ is an /automatic tool/:
it is a tool that runs by itself; it has its own behavior.

A hammer doesn't have its own behaviors.
A car has its own behaviors.
A computer has its own behaviors.
** What does it mean for a machine to compute a real number?
Computation is approximate expression normalization.
To /compute/ a real number is to calculate some of its digits.
To /compute/ an arithmetic /expression/ is to /evaluate/ it (to reduce it into a /value/), often approximately.
For example: 1/7 is an /expression/, and .142 is a /value/ that is the 3 most significant digits of the result of /evaluating/ that expression.

Why do we feel that 1.412 is /more evaluated/ than \(\sqrt{2}\)?
Why do we feel that 1.412 is a /normal form/?
Because it is /physically easier/ for us to locate 1.412 on the real number line than to locate \(\sqrt{2}\).
Thus to compute a real number is to /locate it/ on the real number line.
This justifies the geometric interpretation of real numbers.

We can /partially evaluate/ an expression, such as from 1+2-1 to 3-1.

See also:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_computer

Don't conflate a /real-number expression/ and a /real number/.
A real-number expression /evaluates/ to a real number.
A real-number expression /is not/ a real number.

Let \(E(\Real)\) be the set of all real-number expressions.

Let \(f:E(\Real)\to\Real\) be the evaluation function.

Questions:
- What is the machine computing when I'm typing this document?
- There are several ways of defining the real numbers.
  Which one should we use for the philosophy of mind and computation, and why?

Algebraic-geometric definition:
A /real number/ is a /point/ in the /totally-ordered/ set of points in /one-dimensional/ Euclidean geometry;
the real numbers form a /field/.

Addition also has a geometric meaning: it is the set of points on the plane \(\{(x,y,z) ~\vert~ x+y=z\}\).
** Algorithm, machine, describability, computability
We assume that these are primitive concepts: algorithm, machine.
By "machine", we mean a computing machine.

An algorithm /describes/ what a machine /computes/.

An /algorithm/ is an /executable description/: a string in a formal language in a formal system.
A description has /finite/ length.
By "executable", we mean that an algorithm has a /machine model/.
We always define an algorithm with respect to a machine.

Thus not every real number is /describable/,
because there are fewer strings in that formal language than there are real numbers.

Thus not every real number is /computable/,
because computability requires describability.

Remember that a /formal system/ is a /formal language/ and a set of /inference rules/.
- https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/42443/relationship-between-formal-system-and-formal-languages

An algorithm is a string in a formal language \(L\).
We /model/ a /machine/ as a /formal system/ whose language is \(L\).
The machine is not the formal system.
The thing is not the model.

*What does it mean for a machine to /compute/ a real number?*

Suppose that \(Y(T) \in \Real\) is the /output/ of the algorithm \(A\) if we let the algorithm run for duration \(T \in \Nat\).

The algorithm \(A\) /computes/ the /limit/ of the approximation sequence \( \langle Y(t) \rangle_{t \in \Nat} \).
Thus "\(A\) computes real number \(R\)" means that the limit of that sequence is \(R\).

More explicitly, we say "the algorithm \(A\) /computes/ the real number \(R\)" to mean:
for every approximation error \(E > 0\) that we are willing to have,
there exists a duration \(T \in \Nat\) such that \(\abs{Y(T) - R} < E\).
Informally, the algorithm can always take more time to satisfy ever-diminishing (but still positive) approximation error.

A real number \(R\) is /computable/ iff there is an algorithm that computes \(R\).

There are as many natural numbers as there are algorithms.
Therefore /not every real number is computable/, because there are fewer natural numbers than real numbers.

See also:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_sequence
** What it means for an algorithm to compute a function
The algorithm \(A\) /computes/ the function \(f : A \to B\) iff for every input \(x \in A\), the algorithm outputs \(f(x)\).
** Machine, algorithm, embodiment, computation
A machine /embodies/ an algorithm.
A machine /computes/ what the algorithm computes.

"To /program/ a machine to compute X" is to /arrange/ the machine to compute X,
for example: rewire the machine, load another set of punch cards, write a program in a text editor, etc.

* Knowledge, consciousness
#+TOC: headlines 2 local
** Properties/behaviors of knowledge, propagation
We don't know what "knowledge" is.
But, for this section, assume that we know.

We think we can share or transfer some knowledge.

We can /transfer/ some knowledge by /simulation/.
Simulator-trained pilots /know/ how to fly planes:
If they can fly the planes in the simulator, they can fly the planes in reality.

We can /transfer/ some knowledge by /teaching/.
School teachers /transfer/ knowledge to their students.

Language enables some knowledge transfer.

We don't know how to transfer other knowledge.
The taste of salt.
The hue of green.

Perhaps someday technology will enable transferring all knowledge.
** Knowledge, software, copy, and move
We can /copy/ knowledge, but not /move/ knowledge.
This is similar to software: it can be copied but not moved.
By move I mean: when you move your car from place A to place B, the car is now at B, and is no longer at A.
But we don't /move/ software from hardware A to hardware B;
we /copy/ it from A to B, and then /delete/ the copy at A.
The same with knowledge:
We don't move it from person A to person B;
we /copy/ it; we spread it; and we don't know how to /delete/ knowledge from a person.

Books are not knowledge.
Books contain /text/, not knowledge.
Destroying a book is like destroying a computer disk that contains a program.
** Old English, ken, wit, and knowledge
German has "kennen" and "wissen".
English has "ken" and "wit".

To ken something is to have experienced something.

To wit something is to remember something.

- https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kennen#Usage_notes
- https://yourdailygerman.com/what-is-the-difference-wissen-and-kennen/

"I know that water is H2O" means "I /trust/ the book that says water is H2O".

"I know how beef tastes" means "I /have experienced/ the taste of beef, and I believe that all beef tastes that way".

"I don't know what 2 times 1234567 is" means "I know how to compute the result but I /don't bother/ to".

"I don't know whether the Riemann hypothesis is true" means I don't know.

"I know the Pythagorean theorem"

"I know a proof of the Pythagorean theorem"

"I know a person who can do that"

In all cases, knowledge implies /memory/.
** Consciousness is the ability to know.
<2018-11-04>

/Consciousness/ is the ability to know.

Something is /conscious/ iff it /can know/.

While I'm sleeping, I'm /unconscious/ (I have /low consciousness/), because I can only know very little while I'm sleeping.

I have /more consciousness/ when I'm awake than when I'm asleep,
because I /can know more/ when I'm awake than when I'm asleep.

Why are we so sure that a rock doesn't know anything?

On the etymology of the word "conscious",
[[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conscious][Wiktionary]]
says that it comes from Latin "con-" (together) and "scire" (to know).
*** Defining consciousness requires epistemology.
Defining consciousness as "the ability to know" raises two questions:
What does it mean to /know/ something?
What does it mean to be /able/ to do something?

"What does it mean to know something" is the question that epistemology aims to answer.

Thus defining consciousness requires epistemology.
*** How do we measure consciousness (ability to know)?
How do we measure whether X has more consciousness than Y?
*** Hypothesis: Consciousness requires sense, memory, and feedback.
- Imagine something.
- Imagine that you are imagining something.
- Imagine that the imagined you are in turn imagining something else.
  Is this even possible?
- To manipulate your consciousness,
  you must consciously intend to manipulate your consciousness.
  Can you consciously manipulate your consciousness?
- Consciousness needs sensory input.
- Consciousness needs feedback.
- Self concept needs feedback.
- If there is not a feedback, a system cannot distinguish itself from its environment.
  The self concept will never arise.
- If a brain can immediately control a thing,
  then that thing is part of the brain's self concept.
  If the brain can't, it's not.
- If a brain often gets certain input shortly after it produces certain output,
  it will associate the output with its self concept.
- The self is the thing under conscious control.
- It seems that:
  - Consciousness requires sense.
  - Consciousness requires memory.
  - Consciousness requires feedback.
- It seems that consciousness is (itself, or is caused by?)
  the feedback of information from the immediate past.
**** Memory is necessary but not sufficient for consciousness.
- If I don't have memory, I can't bunch my past self and my present self into the same identity.
**** Identity?
- Cutting off the legs of a person does not change the identity of that person.
  All of his memories are intact.
  Veterans who lost their legs in war retains their pre-war memories.
- Some brain damage changes the identity of the person.
**** Prerequisites of consciousness?
- What is /necessary/ for consciousness?
  - Thought experiment: If someone is born without any senses, it cannot be conscious?
  - Thought experiment: Of an average adult, if all motor nerves are cut, and all sensor nerves are intact,
    then he is conscious intensionally but not extensionally?
    - If we cut all efferent nerve connections,
      the person will behave the same as the one in vegetative coma.
      If we remove the prefrontal cortex,
      the person will still show vital signs, but will be vegetative.
  - Infer: Consciousness has something to do with the brain. (What is it?)
    - Observe: A brain-damaged person does not exhibit conscious behavior.
    - Assume: Philosophical zombie does not exist.
    - Assume: Trapped consciousness does not exist.

"If an acquaintance suddenly contacts you after a long time of silence, he is trying to sell you insurance."

"If the cloud looks gray, it's going to rain."

* Self, mind, brain, soul, and volition
#+TOC: headlines 2 local
** Prerequisites
- philosophy of computer science (what software is)
** Conclusions
The /self/ of X is everything that X /controls/.

The /mind/ is what /thinks/ thoughts.

It is the /mind/ that /thinks/, not the /brain/.

(This may change. I'm still exploring.)
** Nonlocal what?
"Nonlocal Mind: Best Updated Empirical and Theoretical Evidence"
http://www.patriziotressoldi.it/cmssimpled/index.php?page=best-updated-empirical-and-theoretical-evidence
** Mind is what thinks thoughts.
<2018-11-04>
English suggests that /the mind is what thinks thoughts/:
It feels wrong to substitute "What's in your mind?" with "What's in your brain?".
/It is the mind that thinks, not the brain./

Brain contains brain matter.
Mind contains thoughts.

"Mind contains thoughts" implies that mind has a boundary.

** Self is the extent of control.
<2018-11-03>

A system's self is everything that it controls.

The /self/ of X is everything that X /controls/.

Example.
A brain's self is everything that the brain controls.
My self is everything I control.

*Beware of confusion with reflexive pronouns*

Don't conflate "my self" and "myself".

I = myself.
Both of them /refer to the same thing/.
"Myself" is an English reflexive pronoun.

My self = everything that I control.

Don't conflate "itself" and "its self".
*** Supports
- The definition is /not anthropocentric/.
  It does not assume that a self belongs to a human.
- The definition /does not require consciousness/.
*** Possibly objectionable consequences
- A rich person has /more self/ than a poor person because the rich person /controls more/ things than the poor person.
- If another person B absolutely obeys all my orders, then B is a part of my self.
- An electrical circuit with feedback has a self.
*** Self-control?
The self-control of X is X's control of X?

My self-control is my control of me?

An example system with self-control is a lithium-ion battery with protection circuit?

"Self-control, an aspect of inhibitory control, is the ability to regulate one's emotions, thoughts, and behavior in the face of temptations and impulses"
according to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-control][Wikipedia]].
*** Further questions
- What is the relationship between control, intention, and causality?
*** Set-theoretic definition of self
The self of X is the /set/ of everything that X controls.
Therefore, because selves are sets, they can intersect and join.
This is an ordinary set theory in mathematics.

If there is an overlap between what A controls and what B controls,
then they /share/ that overlapping part of their selves.
That overlapping part is a /joint/ self.

The size of self may vary over time.

Selves may /merge/ and /split/.
When I'm using a computer, some of the computer's self and some of my self /merge/ into a bigger self.
When I'm not using the computer, our selves /split/.

If I sever my hand, then that hand ceases to be a part of my self, because I can no longer control it.
If I reattach it, it becomes a part of my self again, although I may not control it as well as before.

*** TODO What is the relationship between control, causality, agency, subject, and subjective experience?

- "The self is an individual person as the object of his or her own reflective consciousness.

Hallucination is when brain confuses input and output?

I have experienced these first-hand:
- sleep paralysis: when going from sleep to wake, can move eyes, can breathe, but can't move other muscles, not even speak
- hypnagogic jerk: the feeling of falling when going from wake to sleep

<2018-11-07>
The difference between imagination and hallucination is /voluntary of existence/.
We can start imagining at will.
We can stop imagining at will.
We cannot start hallucinating at will.
We cannot stop hallucinating at will.
"At will" means "voluntarily", that is, "by volition".

Example.
I can imagine an elephant for three seconds, and then stop imagining it.
But, if I eat a psychedelic mushroom,
I can't stop the hallucination by sheer will,
but eventually my brain chemistry returns to normal and the hallucination ends.

Imagination: mind affects brain.
Hallucination: brain affects mind.

This explains why people can't die /just by wanting/ to die:
because the mind does not fully control the brain.

How do we complete this table?

By now I would have concluded that brain controls mind, if I hadn't heard of Pim van Lommel's near-death experiments.

I want to believe that the brain control the mind, but there are Pim van Lommel's near-death experiments.

An outlandish explanation attempt: interfering parallel universes.
There is a parallel universe where Pim told his patients.
That universe interferes with our universe.

Scientists have assembled a bacterium.

A newborn fails the self-awareness test.

A system is self-aware means that a system know its self or itself?

Does a newborn have subjective experience?

How does subjective existence arise?

Don't conflate "consciousness" and "subjective experience". Consciousness is the ability to know. Your subjective experience is your first-person view.

Does an imaginary person have a real subjective experience? (Does this question even make sense?)

Does a sim in the game "The Sims" have a subjective experience?

Is it possible to believe something true but for the wrong reason?

* TODO Implication (do not read; conversion errors)
<2017-10-21T15:30:00+0700>

This section contains conversion errors.

Plan: Salvage the parts of this section into the parent document.
** Abstract
The /implication/ $A \to B$ means that $A$ /restricts/ $B$.

We introducture an /implication system/,
which involves a metric and a freedom function.
We unify (generalizes?) material implication in classical logic
and conditional probability in probability theory.

(Need better abstract. Answer "Why should I care?")
** What does implication mean?
(This section needs rereading and rewriting.)

We read the sentence $p \to q$ as "$p$ implies $q$'' or"if $p$, then $q$''.

What does $p \to q$ mean?

It means that:

- If we know $p$, then we can infer $q$.
- If we don't know $p$, then the implication does not say anything at all.
- Knowing $p$ allows us to /predict/ $q$.
- $p$ gives information about $q$.
- $p$ determines $q$.
- $p$ restricts $q$.

We can formalize this constraint by using a /metric/ $d : [0,1]^2 \to [0,1]$
and a function $u : [0,1]^2 \to [0,1]$.
We can formalize the constraint as the following inequality:

\begin{align}
    d(\tau(p), \tau(q)) \le u(\tau(p), \tau(p \to q))
\end{align}

where the function $u$ must satisfy $u(0,x) = u(x,0) = 1$ for all $x \in [0,1]$, and $u(1,1) = 0$.
The right-hand side of the inequality says that the maximum distance depends only on $\tau(p)$ and $\tau(p \to q)$.
(As we increase our certainty about both the premise and the implication, we become more certain about the conclusion.)
*** Deriving the constraint
If both $\tau(p)$ and $\tau(p \to q)$ are high, then the constraint is quite strict, and $\tau(q)$ should be near $\tau(p)$.

The /modus ponens/ is
"if we are sure about $p$ and we are sure about $p \to q$, then we can be sure about $q$''.
We can say that more formally as
"if $\tau(p)$ is high, and $\tau(p \to q)$ is high, then $\tau(q)$ should be high''.

The number $\tau(p \to q)$ should describe how /strictly/ $\tau(p)$ constrains $\tau(q)$.
Let's consider the corner cases first to gain some intuition for later generalization.
The corner cases are:

- If $\tau(p) = 0$, then $\tau(q)$ is not constrained.
  (If we aren't sure about the premise, we can't make a conclusion, regardless of how sure we are about the implication.)
- If $\tau(p \to q) = 0$, then $\tau(q)$ is not constrained.
  (If we aren't sure about the implication, we can't make a conclusion, regardless of how sure we are about the premise.)
- If $\tau(p) = 1$ and $\tau(p \to q) = 1$, then $\tau(q)$ has no freedom at all, and it must be $\tau(q) = \tau(p) = 1$.
  (If we are sure about both the premise and the implication, then we can make the conclusion.)
- If we know that $\tau(p)$ is low or $\tau(p \to q)$ is low, then knowing any of those does not enable us to infer anything about $\tau(q)$.
*** Algebra of metrics
If $d$ is a metric and $k$ is a constant, then $d' = (x,y) \to k \cdot d(x,y)$ is also a metric?

If $d_1$ and $d_2$ are metrics then $d_1 + d_2$ is a metric?

If $d_1$ and $d_2$ are metrics then $d_1 \cdot d_2$ is a metric?

A linear combination of metrics is a metric.
*** Consequent freedom functions
If $u$ is a consequent freedom function, then so is $u' = (x,y) \to [u(x,y)]^k$ for all real $k > 0$.

If each of $u_1, \ldots, u_n$ is a consequent freedom function,
and if $\sum_{k=1}^n w_k = 1$,
then $u' = (x,y) \to \sum_{k=1}^n w_k \cdot u_k(x,y)$ is also a consequent freedom function.

An example function that satisfies those constraints is $u(x,y) = 1 - xy$.
Indeed, for every real $k > 0$, the definitions $u(x,y) = 1 - (xy)^k$ and $u(x,y) = (1 - xy)^k$ satisfy those constraints.
For simplicity, until there is reason for doing otherwise, we pick $d(x,y) = |x - y|$ (norm-1) and $u(x,y) = 1 - xy$, and therefore we obtain
the following special case:

\begin{align}
    | \tau(p) - \tau(q) | \le 1 - \tau(p) \cdot \tau(p \to q).
\end{align}

Let $P = \tau(p)$, $Q = \tau(q)$, and $R = \tau(p \to q)$.

\begin{align}
    (P-Q)^2 &amp;\le 1 - PR
    \\ (P-Q)^2-1 &amp;\le - PR
    \\ (P-Q+1)(P-Q-1) &amp;\le - PR
    \\ PR &amp;\le (P-Q+1)(P-Q-1)
    \\ R &amp;\le \frac{(P-Q+1)(P-Q-1)}{P}
    \\ R &amp;\le \left(1 - \frac{Q-1}{P}\right) \left( 1 - \frac{Q+1}{P}\right)
\end{align}

Another example is $u(x,y) = 1 - \min(x,y)$.
Can it be written $u(x,y) = \neg (x \wedge y)$, as in fuzzy logic?

If we know $\tau(p)$ and $\tau(p \to q)$, but we don't know $\tau(q)$, then we can estimate $\tau(q)$ as the midpoint.
Let $P = \tau(p)$, let $Q = \tau(q)$, and let $R = \tau(p \to q)$.

\begin{align}
    - u(P,R) &amp;\le P - Q \le u(P,R)
    \\ - P - u(P,R) &amp;\le -Q \le -P + u(P,R)
    \\ P + u(P,R) &amp;\ge Q \ge P - u(P,R)
    \\ \hat{Q} &amp;= P
\end{align}

WTF...

(RAMBLE)

In classical logic, knowing $\tau(p)$ and $\tau(q)$
allows us to determine $\tau(p \to q)$.
/This does not make sense./
It should be the other way around:
knowing $\tau(p \to q)$ should allow us to use $\tau(p)$ to restrict $\tau(q)$.

We may know something for sure because
we defined it to be true
or we experienced it ourselves through our senses.

In classical logic, $\tau(p)$ is either 0 or 1,
and $\tau(p) = 0$ means that $p$ is false,
and $\tau(p) = 1$ means that $p$ is true.
*** Principle of non-contradiction
Principle of non-contradiction:
$\tau(p) = -1$ if we know that $p$ is false.

Should we accept this principle?

Therefore $\tau(\neg p) = - \tau(p)$.

Does paraconsistent logic make sense?
** Implication system
*** Definition of implication system
A /unit metric/ is a metric whose inputs and output are in the unit real line $[0,1]$.
More specifically, a /unit metric/ is a function $d : [0,1]^2 \to [0,1]$ satisfying the following /metric axioms/ for all $x,y,z \in [0,1]$:

\begin{align}
    d(x,x) &amp;= 0,
    \\ d(x,y) &amp;= d(y,x),
    \\ d(x,z) &amp;\le d(x,y) + d(y,z).
\end{align}

A /consequent freedom function/ is a function $u : [0,1]^2 \to [0,1]$
satisfying \eqref{mdf_axiom_1} to \eqref{is_mono_2}
for all $x,y,y' \in [0,1]$, and $c \in (0,1)$:
\begin{align}
    u(1,1) &amp;= 0, \label{mdf_axiom_1}
    \\ u(0,x) &amp;= 1,
    \\ u(x,0) &amp;= 1,
    \\ y \le y' &amp;\implies u(c,y) \ge u(c,y'), \label{is_mono_1}
    \\ y \le y' &amp;\implies u(y,c) \ge u(y',c). \label{is_mono_2}
\end{align}
The constraints \eqref{is_mono_1} and \eqref{is_mono_2} say that $u$ is monotonically non-increasing with respect to each argument.

An /implication system/ is a tuple $(S,\tau,d,u)$
plus the constraints \eqref{is-cstr-begin} to \eqref{imp-constr}.

The set $S$ is a set of /sentences/.
This set is closed under implication:
\begin{align}
    p \in S \wedge q \in S \implies (p \to q) \in S. \label{is-cstr-begin}
\end{align}

The function $\tau : S \to [0,1]$ is a /truth value function/.

The function $d$ is a /unit metric/.

The function $u$ is a /consequent freedom function/.

The system must satisfy \eqref{imp-constr} for all $p,q \in S$:
\begin{align}
    d(\tau(p), \tau(q)) &amp;\le u(\tau(p), \tau(p \to q)). \label{imp-constr}
\end{align}
We call \eqref{imp-constr} the /meaningful implication constraint/.
(Need a better name.)
(Simplify this definition.)
*** Known instances
These systems are implication systems: - classical logic - probability theory

Need to find out:

- possibility theory
- minimal logic
- paraconsistent logic
- Dempster--Shafer theory
- evidential decision theory

\begin{m:lem}
Classical logic is an implication system.
\begin{proof}
In classical logic, \\( \tau(p \to q) = 0 \\) iff \\( (\tau(p),\tau(q)) = (1,0) \\),
and \\( \tau(p \to q) = 1 \\) otherwise.
To see that classical logic satisfies \eqref{imp-constr},
use proof by cases on \eqref{imp-constr}.
\end{proof}
\end{m:lem}
\begin{m:lem}
Probability theory is an implication system.
\begin{proof}
In probability theory, \\( \tau \\) is the *probability measure*,
and \eqref{imp-constr} translates to \eqref{lem-prob-is-1}, which is equivalent to \eqref{lem-prob-is-2}.
\begin{align}
    |P(A) - P(B)| &amp;\le 1 - P(A) \cdot P(B|A) \label{lem-prob-is-1}
    \\ |P(A) - P(B)| &amp;\le 1 - P(A \cap B) \label{lem-prob-is-2}
\end{align}

We split \eqref{lem-prob-is-2} into two cases.

The first case \\( P(A) - P(B) \le 0 \\) is proven below.
\begin{align}
-(P(A) - P(B)) &amp;\le 1 - P(A \cap B)
\\ P(B) - P(A) &amp;\le 1 - P(A \cap B)
\\ \underbrace{P(B)}_{\in [0,1]} + \underbrace{[P(A \cap B) - P(A)]}_{\le 0} &amp;\le 1
\end{align}

The second case \\( P(A) - P(B) \ge 0 \\) is proven below.
\begin{align}
P(A) - P(B) &amp;\le 1 - P(A \cap B)
\\ \underbrace{P(A)}_{\in [0,1]} + \underbrace{[P(A \cap B) - P(B)]}_{\le 0} &amp;\le 1
\end{align}

Therefore, both cases hold,
and thus probability theory is an implication system.
\end{proof}
\end{m:lem}
In probability theory, conditional probability is $P(A) \cdot P(B|A) = P(A \cap B)$,
which can also be written $\tau(p) \cdot \tau(p \to q) = \tau(p \wedge q)$.
If all samples are equiprobable, then the $P(B|A)$ measures how much of $B$ is inside $A$.
If the intersection of $A$ and $B$ is not empty, then $0 \le P(B|A) \le 1$.
If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then $P(B|A) = 0$.
If $A \subseteq B$, then $P(B|A) = 1$.
*** Probability theory
Probability theory also allows us to compute $\tau(p \to q)$ by conditional probabilities $\tau(p) \cdot \tau(p \to q) = \tau(p \wedge q)$.
** Induction
*** Justifying induction with probability theory
Let $X \subseteq \Omega$ be a set of some samples.
For every $x \in X$, we can observe $x$ and compute $\tau(x)$.

Induction works because /the sample mean is an unbiased esimator of the population mean/.
If you pick 100 /random/ people, and 55 are male,
then it is rational to generalize that to the assumption that 55% of the human population is male.
You cannot infer this from your friends because they are not random.

Let $P(X) = \{ x ~|~ p(x) \}$ where $p$ is a predicate.
Let $\Omega$ be the universe of discourse.
Let $E \subseteq \Omega$ and $E' \subseteq \Omega$.
Then, \eqref{ind} states that every additional evidence makes the induction more reasonable.
\begin{align}
E \subseteq E' \to \tau(P(E) \to P(\Omega)) \le \tau(P(E') \to P(\Omega)) \label{ind}
\end{align}
** Conditionals
*** Types of conditionals according to logic, philosophy, and linguistics
There are several types of conditionals:
causal, strict, indicative, counterfactual, strict, material, formal.
*** Eight types of conditionals by the truth values of the parts
If $\tau(p) = 1$ means that all swans are white,
then $\tau(p) = 0.99$ should mean that almost all swans are white,
and $\tau(p) = 0$ should mean that we don't have any particular belief about whether swans are white.
Should $\tau(p) = -1$ mean that no swans are white?

There are eight combinations of antecedent, consequent, and implication:

- /total nonsense/ (UUU): If X had been born in a Muslim family, then X would be a Christian now.
- /counterfactual/ (UUR): If X had been born in a Muslim family, then X would be a Muslim now.
- /non-sequitur/ (URU): If X had been born in a Muslim family, I'll get a million dollars.
- ? /ransom/ (URR): If you give me a million dollars, I'll keep working as usual.
- /wishful thinking/ (RUU): If I keep working as usual, I'll get a million dollars.
- /paradox/ (RUR): (Quantum mechanics?)
- /irrelevant/ (RRU): If John is a man, then Mary is a woman.
- /law/ (RRR): reasonable antecedent, reasonable consequent, reasonable implication: Theorems in mathematics.

An implication should become more reasonable as its antecedent becomes more reasonable?
An implication should become more reasonable as its consequent becomes more reasonable?

The function $\tau$
takes a sentence (a belief) and gives a real number in $[0,1]$.
The value $\tau(p \to q)$ describes how justified we are when we infer $q$ just by knowing $p$.

If $p$ causes $q$, then removing $p$ should also remove $q$.
Formally, $(p \to q) \vdash (\neg p \to \neg q)$.

Correlation is a necessary but not sufficient for causation.

Finding common cause: Find $p$ such that $p \to q$ and $p \to r$.

Should $p \to \top$ be equally true to $p$?

Example: John pressed the button, and a light blinked. It is rational for John to reason that if the button were not pressed, the light would not blink. But why is that rational? What is the mathematical justification? The implicit belief that the system always behaves the same way.
The implicit belief is that the button behaves the same at all times.
$\forall t \in \Real, press(t) \to blink(t + 1)$

Every counterfactual reasoning implicitly makes a /ceteris paribus/ (everything else being equal) assumption.
When we make a counterfactual implication,
we assume that everything else other than the premise stays the same in the past we are imagining.
"If the driver was driving more slowly, the driver would have had enough time to brake, and therefore the crash would have been avoided."

Suppose that two cars crashed at an intersection.
What causes the crash?

If we have that axiom, then by $\forall$-elimination we can prove the following, given $t_0 \in \Real$:

$press(t_0) \to blink(t_0 + 1)$

What should $\tau(p \to q)$ be?

Spurious correlation, confounding factor

Is there an example of counterfactual that does not involve time?

$\tau (\forall x \in [0,1], x \in [0,1/2]) = 1/2$
depends on the distribution?
** The axioms
In this section, we list the axioms that $\tau$ has to satisfy.
*** Equations
The equations allow us to rewrite sentences without changing their reasonability.

\eqref{and_idem} and \eqref{or_idem} describe /idempotence/ or /contraction/.
\eqref{and_comm} and \eqref{or_comm} describe /commutativity/.
\eqref{and_assoc} and \eqref{or_assoc} describe /associativity/.
I thought everybody would accept these axioms, but I was wrong,
as these axioms do not hold in /linear logic/,
but for everyday reasoning, I think these axioms should hold.

\begin{align}
\tau(p \wedge p) &amp;= \tau(p) \label{and_idem}
\\ \tau(p \vee p) &amp;= \tau(p) \label{or_idem}
\\ \tau(p \wedge q) &amp;= \tau(q \wedge p) \label{and_comm}
\\ \tau(p \vee q) &amp;= \tau(q \vee p) \label{or_comm}
\\ \tau((p \wedge q) \wedge r) &amp;= \tau(p \wedge (q \wedge r)) \label{and_assoc}
\\ \tau((p \vee q) \vee r) &amp;= \tau(p \vee (q \vee r)) \label{or_assoc}
\end{align}

The following axioms are less obvious.
\eqref{imp_dist_and} and \eqref{imp_dist_or} state that implication distributes conjunction and disjunction on the right side.
\eqref{imp_suf} states that every sufficient cause is a necessary cause.

\begin{align}
\tau(p \to (q \wedge q')) &amp;= \tau((p \to q) \wedge (p \to q')) \label{imp_dist_and}
\\ \tau(p \to (q \vee q')) &amp;= \tau((p \to q) \vee (p \to q')) \label{imp_dist_or}
\\ \tau((p \vee p') \to q) &amp;= \tau((p \to q) \wedge (p' \to q)) \label{imp_suf}
\end{align}

\eqref{curry} is /currying/, which may be obvious if you know functional programming.

\begin{align}
\tau((p \wedge p') \to q) &amp;= \tau(p \to (p' \to q)) \label{curry}
\end{align}
*** Tautologies
\eqref{nowhere} is self-inference.
\eqref{and_elim} is conjunction elimination.
\eqref{or_intro} is disjunction introduction.
\eqref{mp} is modus ponens or implication elimination.
\eqref{imp_and_elim} is relaxing the consequent.
\eqref{syl} is syllogism.
These forms are always valid regardless of the sentences.

\begin{align}
1 &amp;= \tau(p \to p) \label{nowhere}
\\ 1 &amp;= \tau((p \wedge q) \to p) \label{and_elim}
\\ 1 &amp;= \tau(p \to (p \vee q)) \label{or_intro}
\\ 1 &amp;= \tau((p \wedge (p \to q)) \to q) \label{mp}
\\ 1 &amp;= \tau((p \to (q \wedge r)) \to (p \to q)) \label{imp_and_elim}
\\ 1 &amp;= \tau((p \to q) \wedge (q \to r)) \to (p \to r)) \label{syl}
\end{align}

If we accept the law of excluded middle $p \wedge \neg p = \bot$,
then we must also accept the principle of explosion $\bot \to p$,
which is obtained by replacing $q = \bot$ in \eqref{and_elim}.
*** Inequalities
\eqref{and_dom} and \eqref{or_dom} describe /dominance/:
satisfying two sentences are harder than satisfying either of them.
\eqref{prud_ante} and \eqref{prud_cons} are the /axioms of prudence/ that say that
restricting the antecedent or relaxing the consequent strengthens the implication.
$(p \wedge p') \to q$ should not be less reasonable than $p \to q$
because both $p$ and $p'$ are necessary but not sufficient causes of $q$.

\begin{align}
\tau(p \wedge q) &amp;\le \tau(p) \label{and_dom}
\\ \tau(p \vee q) &amp;\ge \tau(p) \label{or_dom}
\\ \tau((p \wedge p') \to q) &amp;\ge \tau(p \to q) \label{prud_ante}
\\ \tau(p \to (q \wedge q')) &amp;\le \tau(p \to q) \label{prud_cons}
\end{align}

The /axiom of precedence of knowledge over inference} \eqref{know*
states that inference (indirect knowledge) should not be more reasonable than experience (direct knowledge).
\begin{align}
\tau(p \to q) = 1 &amp;\implies \tau(p) \ge \tau(q) \label{know}
\end{align}

The explanation for \eqref{imp-constr-lin} begins somewhere before \eqref{imp-constr}.
\begin{align}
|\tau(p) - \tau(q)| &amp;\le 1 - \tau(p) \cdot \tau(p \to q) \label{imp-constr-lin}
\end{align}

A corollary of \eqref{know} follows.

\begin{align}
\tau(p \leftrightarrow q) = 1 &amp;\implies \tau(p) = \tau(q)
\end{align}

## Other

It would be nice if it could be a proper superset of propositional logic.

Trivial:

\begin{align*}
\tau(\bot) &amp;= 0
\\ \tau(\top) &amp;= 1
\end{align*}

Axioms of implication:

\begin{align*}
\tau(p \to \neg p) &amp;= 0
\\ \tau(p \leftrightarrow q) &amp;= \tau((p \to q) \wedge (q \to p))
\end{align*}

Should conditional probability be an axiom?
It generalizes to classical propositional calculus.

\begin{align*}
\tau(p \to q) \cdot \tau(p) &amp;= \tau(p \wedge q)
\end{align*}

Law of excluded middle
(might be controversial):

\begin{align*}
\tau(p \wedge \neg p) &amp;= 0
\\ \tau(p \vee \neg p) &amp;= 0
\\ \tau(p) + \tau(\neg p) &amp;= 1
\end{align*}

It is reasonable to believe something iff it is not reasonable to believe otherwise.
Formally \\( \tau(\neg p) = 1 - \tau(p) \\).

\begin{align}
\tau(p \vee q) &amp;\le \tau(p) + \tau(q) \label{or_tri}
\end{align}

\eqref{or_tri} is the *triangle inequality of disjunctions*. It is still questionable.

## Relation with fuzzy logic

If \\( t \\) is a *t-norm* (as in fuzzy logic) and \\( k \\) is a positive real number,
then \\( u(x,y) = 1 - [t(x,y)]^k \\) satisfy the constraints.

## Tangential remarks

Truth value can be interpreted as truth, belief, probability, or reasonability.

Inductive reasoning helped our ancestors survive the harsh nature.

\\( p \to q \\).
Does it mean "\\( p \\) predicts \\( q \\)"?
Does it mean "\\( p \\) explains \\( q \\)"?
Does it mean "\\( p \\) supports \\( q \\)"?
(It is impossible to know the reality and therefore causation.)
We write \\( p \to q \\) to mean "\\( p \\) causes \\( q \\)".

In practice \\( \tau(p) = 1 \\) iff \\( p \\) is a rule of thought, a mathematical law, or a direct experience.

If \\( p \to q \\), then \\( p \\) gives us information for predicting \\( q \\).

### Examples of problems

The input is a lambda-calculus expression,
the output is its normal form.

The input is a propositional logic expression,
the output is its minimum equivalent expression.

The input is a pair \\( (G,H) \\) of graphs,
the output is whether \\( G \\) and \\( H \\) are isomorphic.

\\( \{ (x,y) ~|~ x^2 = y, ~ y \in \Nat \} \\).

Let \\( c \\) be a constant.
Then \\( con(c,A) = \{ (a,c) ~|~ a \in A \} \\) is a constant problem.

Identity problem \\( id(A) = \{ (a,a) ~|~ a \in A \} \\).

### Examples of formal languages

Example of formal language:
(1) the empty string is in the language;
(2) if \\( x \\) is, then \\( 1x \\) is;
(3) nothing else is.
Then the elements of that set are the empty string,
the string 1, the string 11, the string 111, and so on.

These paragraphs are dense, so read slowly.

Example: natural numbers.
Let \\( L \\) be a language.
Let \\( \{ z,s \} \\) be the alphabet.
Let the *formation rules* of \\( L \\) consist of two rules:
(1) \\( z \in L \\), and
(2) \\( A \in L \implies sA \in L \\).
Examples of some members of \\( L \\) are \\( z, sz, ssz, sssz \\).
We can map a string in \\( L \\) to a natural number.
A possible *interpretation* of \\( L \\) is \\( I : L \to \Nat \\)
where \\( I(z) = 0 \\) and \\( I(sA) = 1 + I(A) \\),
so \\( I(sz) = 1 \\), \\( I(ssz) = 2 \\), \\( I(sssz) = 3 \\), and so on.

Example: natural number equality.
Let \\( L \\) be a language.
Let \\( \{ z,s,=,),( \} \\) be the alphabet.
(1) \\( (z = z) \in L \\) (read that as "the string \\( z = z \\) is a member of \\( L \\)'', *not* "\\( z \\) equals to \\( z \in L \\)''),
(2) \\( (A = B) \in L \implies (sA = sB) \in L \\).

Example: propositional calculus.
Let \\( A \\) be a finite set of letters.
Let \\( L \\) be a language.
\\( \alpha \in A \vdash \alpha \in L \\).
\\( \alpha \in L, \beta \in L \vdash C \alpha \beta \in L \\).
\\( \alpha \in L \vdash N \alpha \in L \\).
Let \\( H : A \to Bool \\).
Let \\( I : L \to Bool \\).

## Definitions

A *problem* is
a set of question-answer pairs.
An *instance* of that problem is an element of that set.
The questions and answers can be anything;
a *problem* is simply a set of ordered pairs.

A *decision problem*
is a problem where each answer is either yes or no.

A formal language *computes* a problem.

Research question:
Why is a problem harder than another problem?

A thing is *computable* iff it is finitely describable;
to *compute* a thing is to construct it from its finite description.
For example, *the set of all natural numbers divisible by two*
is computable, because we have just described it in a few English words,
but things get interesting if we *restrict* our language
and see what descriptions are still possible despite such restrictions.

A *formal language} (or just a /language* if there is no ambiguity) is a set of strings,
and this set can be described by rules.

From a set $S$ and a language $L$,
several questions arise:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can \\( L \\) *describe* \\( S \\)?
    \item If \\( L \\) can describe \\( S \\), *how short* can the description be?
    \item *How much time* do we need to construct a thing from its description?
\end{enumerate}
(RAMBLE)

Sometimes we write $P(x,y)$ to mean $(x,y) \in P$.
But this conflates a set and a predicate that describes the set.

Axioms of probabilistic propositional calculus?
- Boolean truth value $\{ 0,1 \}$ generalizes to real number probability $[0,1]$.
- Sentence generalizes to event (subset of sample space).
- $t(p \wedge q) = \min(t(p),t(q))$
- Find $t$ such that $t$ is a probability measure and $t(p) \le t(p \wedge q)$, $t(p \vee q) \le t(p)$.
- A logical predicate becomes an event family (input: sample; output: set of samples).
- Does it make sense to define $t(p \to q) = \Pr (q|p)$ (Bayes's law)?
- What is $t(\forall x \in A, p(x))$? It is $\Pr (x \in A \to p(x))$.
- The truth value function takes a logical /sentence/ (it cannot contain any free variables) and outputs a real number.
- The statement "every swan is white" is not entirely wrong.

*** Neuropsychology
**** 2017 article "The Status and Future of Consciousness Research" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641373/
- This article makes me sure that
  I'm not interested in how to measure consciousness,
  I'm not interested in neural correlates of consciousness,
  and I'm not interested in neuroscience.
- Consciousness research is multidisciplinary.
  - "Cognitive scientists and neuroscientists agreed that the philosophical problems of why and how there is consciousness are also their problems.
    Philosophers agreed that empirical evidence may resolve or at least influence this debate.
    Scientists across disciplines generally agree that consciousness is subjective, characterized by a kind of privileged first-person access."
- Challenges
  - "One major obstacle for consciousness research is the lacking consensus of how to optimally measure consciousness empirically."
  - "Another major challenge is how to identify neural correlates of consciousness."
- "The future challenges"
  - "One major future challenge will be how to measure consciousness 'from the outside'."
  - "One possibly even greater challenge will be to reintegrate the philosophical metaphysical debate into the scientific work."
- "Future directions"
  - "Currently, consciousness research is often considered a 'topic'—or even 'niche'—under the umbrella of cognitive neuroscience."
**** 2011 article "Understanding Brain, Mind and Soul: Contributions from Neurology and Neurosurgery" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3115284/
- The section "The Mind" correlates brain damage and behavior change.
- The section "Where is the Mind Located?" says "The brain is the organ of the mind just as the lungs are the organs for respiration."
- "How does the Mind Function?"
  - "Krishnamoorthy (2009) uses an analogy based on computers to explain the workings of the mind: [...]"
  - "The mind cannot be localised to particular areas within the brain, [...]"
- "The Soul"; "The search and some conclusions"
  - "In 1907, Dr. Duncan MacDougall of Haverhill, Massachusetts, decided to weigh the soul by weighing a human being in the act of death."
  - "If there be a soul, where is it located? Views of neuroscientists"
    - "If we accept the existence of the soul and its localisation in the brain, we must focus on the brainstem."
- "Take home message"
  - "The study of the brain, mind and soul has engaged some of the finest intellects of yesteryears.
    It remains an ennobling and inspiring pursuit, worthy of all those who are dedicated votaries of science."
- "Questions That This Paper Raises"
  - "2. Do you agree with the author’s conclusions on the mind in the brain?"
    - My objections to the article
      - <2018-11-04>
        I doubt "The brain is the organ of the mind [...]";
        near-death experience research suggests that the mind can function without brain activity.
*** Popular science
**** 2013 article "Distinguishing Brain From Mind" https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/05/distinguishing-brain-from-mind/276380/
- "In coming years, neuroscience will answer questions we don't even yet know to ask.
  Sometimes, though, focus on the brain is misleading."
- Neurocentric/reductionistic/materialistic approach to addiction theory, that focuses on the brain but ignores the mind, is wrong.
**** 2013 article "Why are top scientists [...] interested in researching human consciousness?" https://www.mindscience.org/index.php/research/the-scientific-study-of-consciousness.html
- "modern brain imaging seems to indicate that it is Spinoza's concept of an integrated mind-body that is closer to reality."
- "psychologist William James' great work on consciousness in the late 1800s is slowly regaining the pivotal position it deserves in understanding and interpreting human behavior."
- "technological advances in brain imaging have given scientists a new range of tools to more accurately observe and measure the apparent causes and manifestations of consciousness."
*** Nonlocality
**** 2016 Pim van Lommel interview "Continuity of non-local consciousness" https://www.landelijkexpertisecentrumsterven.nl/inspiratie/continuity-of-non-local-consciousness/
- Which experiment of continuity of nonlocal consciousness convinces you the most?
  - "the studies of near-death experience (NDE) in survivors of cardiac arrest"
  - "Based on these NDE-studies one can conclude that there are good reasons to assume that our consciousness does not always coincide with the functioning of our brain"
  - "most likely the brain must have a facilitating and not a producing function to experience consciousness"
  - "Also cases of after-death communication (ADC), with communication with the consciousness of deceased loved ones, and sometimes information was shared that was not yet known"
  - "Like the NDE there is also a huge taboo to talk about ADCs, because they cannot be 'objectively proven'."
- How did you contribute?
  - "our prospective study in survivors of cardiac arrest"
  - "after the temporary loss of all functions of the brain during clinical death (= cardiac arrest) the experience of enhanced consciousness was still possible in 18% of those patients"
- "How close do you feel we are in establishing without a doubt that there is life after death?"
  - "it will never be possible to 'prove' this idea because consciousness is subjective, and (materialist) science uses only objective methodology"
  - "The scientific study of NDE pushes us to the limits of our medical and neurophysiological ideas about the range of human consciousness and mind-brain relation."
**** 2016 article https://explore.scimednet.org/index.php/all-physics-is-nonlocal/
- "there is no agreement among physicists on what nonlocality means"
- "Bohmian mechanics is different from traditional quantum mechanics, in that particles follow definite trajectories, and possess both a definite position and momentum.
  This doesn’t violate the uncertainty principle, because that principle only places limits to what we can know about position and momentum.
  What Bohm said is that a quantum particle has a real as opposed to statistical existence, [...]"
- "Nonlocal behavior is seen most plainly in the behavior of entangled particles as described by Bell’s Theorem."
**** 2017 article https://bigthink.com/robby-berman/is-consciousness-in-the-physical-world-we-may-be-about-to-find-out
- Lucien Hardy "has an experiment to see if the mind operates on a quantum level."

  - 2015 article "Loophole-free Bell inequality violation using electron spins separated by 1.3 kilometres" https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15759
- "It’s a Bell test that Hardy is interested in running, with an added wrinkle of his own.
  Instead of varying the properties to be observed using random number generators,
  he proposes observing entangled particles with A and B detection units positioned 100 kilometers apart,
  and whose settings are controlled by EEG signals from headsets on 100 human volunteers."
**** 2015 article "Does consciousness go beyond the brain?" https://noetic.org/blog/arnaud-delorme/does-consciousness-go-beyond
- "What is the evidence so far?"
- "Currently consciousness is considered by mainstream science as an epiphenomenon often with no causal consequence that emerges from this structure in a sort of magical way.
  The prevailing view is that consciousness an illusion created by the brain."
- "One of our main approach [...] is to perform scientific experiments which attempt to show the non locality of consciousness."
- "If consciousness is non-local, then certainly the 'consciousness in the brain' hypothesis must be revised."

*** TODO Ruminations about control
Example.
A feedback system /controls/ its output?
I don't /control/ what you say but I /control/ my emotion.
Who is /in control/?
The situation is getting /out of control/?
I /control/ the character's motions using this /controller/.

"Control [...] is a word with diverse meanings and applications,
ranging from those found in control theory regarding dynamical systems,
self-control of one's own behavior,
social control of processes and political mechanisms that regulate individual and group behaviour,
including security controls against perceived or unperceived dangers,
mind control,
in which groups or individuals systematically use unethically manipulative methods to direct others,
and scientific control to isolate variables in experiments." https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Control

Control is going against nature?
How can we go against nature if we are part of nature?
How can nature go against nature?

Control is making something go against what it would go when left alone.

Control is limit.

Control is giving commands.

"To control" means "To exercise influence over; to suggest or dictate the behavior of" according to [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/control#Verb][Wiktionary]].
Thus X controls Y iff X influences Y's behavior.

What is "influence"?
**** Failed ruminations
***** X /controls/ Y iff X does what Y /wants/ X to do.
I control something iff it does what I want.

Problematic consequence of that definition:
If, by luck, Y happens to be already doing what X wants, then the definition says that X controls Y.
Example: If I want you to do what you do, the definition says I control you.

I wanted to read "Book of why", but I changed my mind.

This book narrates Judea Pearl's hard-won war against anti-causality statisticians.
Most of it is history of 21st century statistics.
A little part describes causal model.

It's too long (400 pages).
It should take at most 20 pages.

Is Pearl 2000 a better book?

Human interprets data.

Science requires philosophy.

To intervene is to control.

To control a variable is to fix its value.

How to read it:
- Read page 111 about junctions: mediators, colliders, forks
  - page 113: "We will now see that this collider pattern works in exactly
the opposite way from chains or forks when we condition on
the variable in the middle."

The collider is counterintuitive. What does it mean to control for an /output variable/?

There is no input/output variable in statistics.

- Read page 149 "The do-operator and the back-door criterion"

"I like to think of the links as pipes that convey information from a starting point X to a finish Y."

"You can enter the room."
Necessity
"S must P in order to C" means that "C is necessary for S to P".

Obligation
"You must enter the room."

It is incorrect to say "you cannot enter this room"; the correct saying is "you must not enter this room".
(You aren't permitted to enter the room; I'm not letting you enter this room.)

Simpler to prove (having shorter proof)? Adding an axiom.
Simpler to write (shorter to write)?

A simplifying assumption is an axiom added to a formal system. This axiom shortens proofs, but reduces correctness.

Buying the lottery is a /necessary/ cause for winning the lottery.

X causes Y iff X raises the probability of Y?

X causes Y iff the absence of X causes the absence of Y?

Personification or shortening

"The author claims X."

"This document claims X."

Causality is the /direction of effect/?
C causes E means C /affects/ E.

These people should collaborate: Judea Pearl, J\"urgen Schmidhuber, Marcus Hutter, Shane Legg:
- Counterfactual reasoning is the about constructing a causal model.
- Algorithmic probability can compute the feasibility of a causal model.

** model?

Model of an axiomatic system
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system#Models




If X models Y and Y models X, then X and Y are the same thing, and the model doesn't have any simplifying assumptions.

"Model"
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry

Euclidean geometry locally models a manifold.

Non-Euclidean geometry removes an axiom from Euclidean geometry. Thus Euclidean-geometry models non-Euclidean geometry, by adding an axiom

The formula p to q models the formula q

The set of all theorems of a formal systema

A formal system F models a formal system G iff every theorem of F is also a theorem of G.

F has axioms A
G has axioms A,B
Same inference rules
Thus every theorem in F is a theorem in G
Is formal system inference rule monotonic?
G is a model of F.
The simplifying assumption is the extra axiom B.
More axioms mean simpler formal system.

Elliptic geometry has fewer axioms than Euclidean geometry, and thus the former is objectively simpler than the latter, but why does the later /feels/ simpler?

Two lines are parallel if and only if they are the same or they don't intersect.

Absolute geometry is a model of Euclidean geometry
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_geometry

Adding axioms make it easier to prove theorems. Adding axioms simplifies (shortens) proofs.

p and q models p with the simplifying assumption q.
