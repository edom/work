* We must agree on these before you read further.
If we don't agree, no communication can happen between us.

I'm not absolutely certain about these assumptions,
but I don't know how I can communicate without them.

I'm happy to change my beliefs if there is a reason for that.

This document is basically my trying to justify my most fundamental beliefs.

/I assume these axioms./

Objective reality exists.

Logic works.

Every statement has exactly one truth value (somewhere in the continuum between false and true), regardless of whether we know it.

/I assume that these concepts are primitive concepts./
I leave them undefined.
They are like the concept of "point" in geometry.
I don't know how to state them in terms of anything simpler.

want, to want.

belief, to believe.

/I assume these synonyms./

imagination, fantasy.
Imagination comes from Latin.
Fantasy comes from Greek.
Imagination and fantasy have the same meaning.
Imagination doesn't have to be visual, although "imagination" and "image" are related.

knowledge, awareness.
These are the same: to /know/ X, to be /aware/ of X.

attention, focus.
* Ability is the existence of satisfying action.
<2018-11-06>

"S can P" means "There exists an action A such that, after S does A, the statement 'S did P' becomes true."
Example:
"I can boil an egg" means "There is something I can do to make the statement 'I did boil an egg' true".

"S cannot P" means "It is false that S can P".
Thus it means "there is /nothing/ S can do to make 'S did P' true."

Problem: "cannot" is hard to prove, if it's even possible to prove at all.
Example: There are several issues with "I can't jump 10 meters high":
- Am I not able to do that, or do I merely not know how to do that?
  There is a difference between /not being able/ and /not knowing how/.
- Linguistic issue: What does "jump" mean? Must I use my own legs?
- Proving a universal negative: How do I know that there is /nothing/ I can do to make "I jumped 10 meters high" true?

People sometimes say "can't" when they mean "won't".
Example:
"I can't wake up earlier."
Of course he /can/; there is a satisfying action: Go to bed earlier, and put the goddamn phone away from bed.
But he doesn't /want/ to.
He should say "I don't want to wake up earlier."
But /can/ doesn't mean /should/.

People sometimes say "can't" when they mean they don't know how.
Example:
"I can't start the car."
Of course he /can/; there is a satisfying action: Fix the car, turn the key, and so on.
But he doesn't /know/ how.
He should say "I don't know how I can start the car" or "The car isn't starting."
That satisfying action /exists/ regardless of whether he knows it.
* To be animate is to have changing wants.
<2018-11-07>

To be /animate/ is to have changing wants.

To be /inanimate/ is to have unchanging wants.

An /animate/ thing is a thing whose want may change.

Problem: Must the wants change?
Or is it sufficient to have the /possibility/ of changing wants, without having to /actually/ ever change wants?
What is the difference between:
one who can do X but never does X, and
one who really can't do X?

An /inanimate/ thing is a thing whose wants don't change.
That inanimate thing always has that same want.

A thing may want nothing (not want anything).
** Life
Synonym: An /animate/ thing is a /living/ thing.
A living thing /lives/.
Thus the meaning of "to live" is "to have changing wants".
Thus the meaning of "life" is, literally, "having changing wants".

Problem: this definition generalizes "to live" too much?
* Cause, make, force, control, want, affect
<2018-11-07>

These mean the same:
"to /cause/ X to do Y",
"to /make/ X do Y",
"to /force/ X to do Y".

"Force" suggests, but does not require, that X would otherwise not do Y if X was not forced to.

Examples:
- I made him clean up his room = I forced him to clean up his room = I caused him to clean up his room.
- I kicked the ball = I made the ball move with my foot = I forced my foot on the ball = I caused the ball to move with my foot.
- "I gave birth to my child" approximately means "I forced my child to exist".

These are synonyms:
to affect, to cause to differ, to change, to influence, to make a difference.

To /affect/ is to /change/ (to /make a difference/).

Example:
I kick the ball.
My existence makes a difference to the ball.
The ball moved because I kicked it.
The ball wouldn't move if I didn't kick it.
/I affect the ball./
* Cause
** Causality jargon
Suppose that there are a button X, a button Y, and a lamp Z,
wired such that Z lights up iff both X and Y are pressed.

Does pressing X cause Z to light up?
No, but it /contributes/.
It is a /causal factor/.
Pressing X is /necessary/, but not /sufficient/, for lighting up Z.

The cause of Z's lighting up is /both/ pressing X and pressing Y.

Other resources:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_the_single_cause
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_and_ultimate_causation
- The "causal model" Wikipedia article summarizes some of Judea Pearl's work. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_model
** Conditional is not causation.
Suppose:
- L1 lights up iff B1 is pressed.
- L2 lights up iff B2 is pressed.
- L3 lights up iff B1 is pressed and B2 is pressed.

Then "if L1 and L2 light up, then L3 lights up" is a true conditional statement,
but "both L1 and L2 light up" is not the cause of "L3 lights up".

** Causation is not transitive.
See the section "3.1. Counterexamples to Transitivity" in the 2017 article "The Transitivity and Asymmetry of Actual Causation".
https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ergo/12405314.0004.001/--transitivity-and-asymmetry-of-actual-causation?rgn=main;view=fulltext
** Suspecting causation from correlation of things that happen almost together
Let C abbreviate Cause.

Let E abbreviate Effect.

"C and E correlate" means that "E happens if C happens, and E doesn't happen if C doesn't happen".

"Immediate" means "within short duration".

If we often see C happen /immediately before/ E,
and we often see C and E /correlate/,
then we may come to /believe/ that C /causes/ E.
To justify this, we tacitly assume that /not much/ can happen in such short duration;
we assume that the /immediate future/ is predictable.
We assume the short duration between C and E makes
it improbable for anything else to /confound/ the way C causes E.
The shorter the duration, the more improbable confounding is.

Consider two drugs: S (Slow) and F (Fast).
Suppose that, in reality,
F makes the person vomit after 1 hour,
and S makes the person vomit after 1 year,
but we don't know those yet.
It is easier for us to see (and conclude) that F causes vomiting than to see that S causes vomiting,
because there are much fewer things that can make the person vomit in 1 hour than in 1 year.

Thus we may define /duration/ as /maximum number of possible events/.
There are more things that may happen in 2 seconds than in 1 second.
What does it mean for something to /happen/?

We may /believe/ that C causes E, but does C /really/ cause E?

I strike a match head.
Then it ignites.

I do that three times with other match heads, and find the same thing.

Thus I generalize: Striking a match head /causes/ its ignition.

Modern physics can explicate the /chain/ of causes (I may mistake the details).
Friction /causes/ the the heating of the stricken part of the match head.
The heat and oxygen /causes/ the ignition of the stricken part.
The ignition /causes/ more conversion of chemical bonds into heat.
The additional heat /causes/ a chain reaction that spreads the flame into nearby unlit parts.

I wet a match head with drinking water.
I strike it.
It doesn't ignite.
I infer that the wetness causes the match head to fail to ignite.
What justifies my inference?

What was causality to early humans?

Can a Hebbian learner learn causality?
** Counterfactual reasoning
/We justify some counterfactuals by frequentist probability./
Suppose that a driver died in a car crash.
We assume that the driver would not have died if the car had not crashed.
Frequentist probability justifies that assumption.
There are many enough car crashes.
We have the statistics.

/We don't know about other counterfactuals./
We don't know what would happen if Hitler won World War 2.
We don't know any way of repeating World War 2 many times.
- How do we justify statements like "If Hitler had never been made a Chancellor, then World War 2 would have never happened."?
  - If Hitler hadn't done it, wouldn't someone else have?
  - If Hitler hadn't done it, wouldn't there be someone else more evil?

What /encumbers reasoning/ is the /multitude of probable causes/, not the /unrepeatability/ of the event.

When reasoning counterfactually, we tacitly assume that /the law of nature doesn't change/.
- We assume that the law of nature is the same 1,000 years ago.
  - It seems that any attempt at justifying this would crash into Hume's induction problem.
    - The law of nature is the same yesterday.
    - The law of nature is the same two days ago.
    - The law of nature has always been the same?
      - We don't know the law of nature before the Big Bang.
    - However, for most practical purposes, the law of nature has always been the same.

* To control is to force wants.
<2018-11-07>

X /controls/ Y iff X /forces/ (causes) Y to do what X /wants/ Y to do.

Remember that "to force" means "to cause".

Remember that we assume that /want/ is a primitive concept.
It doesn't assume what can want and what can't want.

We assume that causation is transitive.

Control is transitive, because causation is transitive.
If X controls Y, and Y controls Z, then X controls Z.
The contraposition: If X doesn't control Z, then: X doesn't control Y, or Y doesn't control Z, or both.

We can use that contraposition to find who controls whom in a company.
Example.
Alice, Bob, and Charlie are in the same company.
In the hierarchy, Alice commands Bob, and Bob commands Charlie.
Alice knows Charlie, but never interacts with Charlie.
If Alice tells Bob to make Charlie do what Alice wants Charlie to do, but Charlie doesn't do it, then there are three possibilities:
Alice doesn't control Bob, or Bob doesn't control Charlie, or both.
* Science aims to find what each inanimate thing wants.
<2018-11-07>

Remember that we assume that /want/ is a primitive concept.
It doesn't assume what can want and what can't want.

What an /inanimate/ thing /wants/ is what it would do if it weren't /forced/ to.
Thus we can find what an inanimate thing want by /isolating/ it so that nothing forces it to do anything.

Example.
Imagine a weight balance.
I put a heavier weight on the left plate.
I put a lighter weight on the right plate.
Both weights /want/ to fall toward the Earth.
The heavier weight /forces/ the lighter weight to rise,
against what the lighter weight /wants/,
against what the lighter weight would do if the heavier weight did not force the lighter weight to rise.

/Science aims to find what each inanimate thing wants./
We isolate inanimate things, so that nothing control them, so that we know how they behave.
We isolate atoms so that we can understand their wants.

Nature /wants/ to enforce the law of nature.

A gas /wants/ to fill its container?

We aren't personifying inanimate things.
They do /want/ something.
It's just that their wants don't change with time.

Every mass /wants/ to attract every other mass.
Earth /wants/ a rock to fall toward the Earth.

What does a voltage regulator want?

There is a difference between these statements:
- Every thing that does not exist wants to continue not-existing.
- Nothing wants to continue not-existing.
** Problem: How do we know that nothing is forcing an inanimate thing to do anything?
Difference of meaning:
- "Nothing" exists = the English word "nothing" exists
- Nothing exists = there does not exist anything; it is not true that anything exists

Which one does "Nothing causes its own existence" mean?
- There isn't anything that causes its own existence.
- There is a thing that we call "nothing", and it causes its own existence.

Can something cause its own existence?
Can something causes itself to exist?
Is there such a thing?

Is there something forcing everything else to exist?

Is everything forced to exist?
Does anything want to exist?

If we assume that something cannot cause its own existence,
then everything must have a cause that is not itself.
Thus there is something /forcing/ everything else to /exist/.

If I don't exist, how can I force myself to exist?
* Knowledge, consciousness
** Some knowledge are transferable.
We can /transfer/ some knowledge by /language/.

We believe that some knowledge is transferrable, although we don't know what knowledge is.

We can /transfer/ some knowledge by /simulation/.
Simulator-trained pilots /know/ how to fly planes:
If they can fly the planes in the simulator, they can fly the planes in reality.

We can /transfer/ some knowledge by /teaching/.
School teachers /transfer/ knowledge to their students.

We don't know how to transfer other knowledge.
The taste of salt.
The hue of green.

Perhaps someday technology will enable transferring all knowledge.

** Plato JTB theory: Knowledge is justified true belief.
Gettier problem?
Can we believe something right for the wrong reason?
** How do we know? Ways of obtaining and justifying knowledge
- Through our senses.
- By logic?
- By divine revelation?
- Telepathy?
- Mind upload?
** Consciousness is the ability to know.
<2018-11-04>

/Consciousness/ is the ability to know.

Something is /conscious/ iff it /can know/.

While I'm sleeping, I'm /unconscious/ (I have /low consciousness/), because I can only know very little while I'm sleeping.

I have /more consciousness/ when I'm awake than when I'm asleep,
because I /can know more/ when I'm awake than when I'm asleep.

Why are we so sure that a rock doesn't know anything?

On the etymology of the word "conscious",
[[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conscious][Wiktionary]]
says that it comes from Latin "con-" (together) and "scire" (to know).
*** Defining consciousness requires epistemology.
Defining consciousness as "the ability to know" raises two questions:
What does it mean to /know/ something?
What does it mean to be /able/ to do something?

"What does it mean to know something" is the question that epistemology aims to answer.

Thus defining consciousness requires epistemology.
*** How do we measure consciousness (ability to know)?
How do we measure whether X has more consciousness than Y?
*** Hypothesis: Consciousness requires sense, memory, and feedback.
- Imagine something.
- Imagine that you are imagining something.
- Imagine that the imagined you are in turn imagining something else.
  Is this even possible?
- To manipulate your consciousness,
  you must consciously intend to manipulate your consciousness.
  Can you consciously manipulate your consciousness?
- Consciousness needs sensory input.
- Consciousness needs feedback.
- Self concept needs feedback.
- If there is not a feedback, a system cannot distinguish itself from its environment.
  The self concept will never arise.
- If a brain can immediately control a thing,
  then that thing is part of the brain's self concept.
  If the brain can't, it's not.
- If a brain often gets certain input shortly after it produces certain output,
  it will associate the output with its self concept.
- The self is the thing under conscious control.
- It seems that:
  - Consciousness requires sense.
  - Consciousness requires memory.
  - Consciousness requires feedback.
- It seems that consciousness is (itself, or is caused by?)
  the feedback of information from the immediate past.
**** Memory is necessary but not sufficient for consciousness.
- If I don't have memory, I can't bunch my past self and my present self into the same identity.
**** Identity?
- Cutting off the legs of a person does not change the identity of that person.
  All of his memories are intact.
  Veterans who lost their legs in war retains their pre-war memories.
- Some brain damage changes the identity of the person.
**** Prerequisites of consciousness?
- What is /necessary/ for consciousness?
  - Thought experiment: If someone is born without any senses, it cannot be conscious?
  - Thought experiment: Of an average adult, if all motor nerves are cut, and all sensor nerves are intact,
    then he is conscious intensionally but not extensionally?
    - If we cut all efferent nerve connections,
      the person will behave the same as the one in vegetative coma.
      If we remove the prefrontal cortex,
      the person will still show vital signs, but will be vegetative.
  - Infer: Consciousness has something to do with the brain. (What is it?)
    - Observe: A brain-damaged person does not exhibit conscious behavior.
    - Assume: Philosophical zombie does not exist.
    - Assume: Trapped consciousness does not exist.
    - [[https://www.quora.com/Can-consciousness-exist-without-sensory-inputs][Quora: Can consciousness exist without sensory inputs?]]
      - dissociative anesthesia? ketamine? sensory deprivation tank?
  - Assume: There is no experiment that can decide between these two things:
    the absence of consciousness, and the absence of efferent nerves?
  - Assume: My consciousness is tied to my body.
  - Assume: When I sleep, my consciousness pauses.
- What is /sufficient/ for consciousness?

Knowledge without justification is "dumb luck": https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/384314/is-there-a-word-for-an-unjustified-true-belief

Thus, a true belief isn't always a knowledge.

Knowledge with justification suffers the Gettier problem.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology#Defining_knowledge
*** TODO What is the difference between knowledge and belief?
**** Knowledge is a /subset/ of belief?
Every knowledge is a belief.
There are beliefs that are not knowledge.

My knowledge of the taste of salt is a belief.

Language is not necessary for belief.
For example, I can falsely believe that I have a shirt with this color that I can see in my mind but I can't describe to you.
**** Wrong: /Knowledge/ is /belief/ that agrees with /reality/.
"We know S" means "we believe S, and S is true".

When we say "S is true", we mean that S is true in objective reality.
**** Belief is not binary
"If an acquaintance suddenly contacts you after a long time of silence, he is trying to sell you insurance."

"If the cloud looks gray, it's going to rain."
**** Distinguishing the absence of belief and the belief of absence
There is a difference between "S does not believe P" and "S believes that P is false".
**** Beliefs that go against reality
False negative: S is true but I believe that S is false.

False positive: S is false but I believe that S is true.

* On self, mind, brain, and volition
** Conclusions
The /self/ of X is everything that X /controls/.

The /mind/ is what /thinks/ thoughts.

It is the /mind/ that /thinks/, not the /brain/.

(This may change. I'm still exploring.)
** Mind is what thinks thoughts.
<2018-11-04>
English suggests that /the mind is what thinks thoughts/:
It feels wrong to substitute "What's in your mind?" with "What's in your brain?".
/It is the mind that thinks, not the brain./

Brain contains brain matter.
Mind contains thoughts.

"Mind contains thoughts" implies that mind has a boundary.

** Self is the extent of control.
<2018-11-03>

A system's self is everything that it controls.

The /self/ of X is everything that X /controls/.

Example.
A brain's self is everything that the brain controls.
My self is everything I control.

*Beware of confusion with reflexive pronouns*

Don't conflate "my self" and "myself".

I = myself.
Both of them /refer to the same thing/.
"Myself" is an English reflexive pronoun.

My self = everything that I control.

Don't conflate "itself" and "its self".
*** Supports
- The definition is /not anthropocentric/.
  It does not assume that a self belongs to a human.
- The definition /does not require consciousness/.
*** Possibly objectionable consequences
- A rich person has /more self/ than a poor person because the rich person /controls more/ things than the poor person.
- If another person B absolutely obeys all my orders, then B is a part of my self.
- An electrical circuit with feedback has a self.
*** Self-control?
The self-control of X is X's control of X?

My self-control is my control of me?

An example system with self-control is a lithium-ion battery with protection circuit?

"Self-control, an aspect of inhibitory control, is the ability to regulate one's emotions, thoughts, and behavior in the face of temptations and impulses"
according to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-control][Wikipedia]].
*** Further questions
- What is the relationship between control, intention, and causality?
*** Set-theoretic definition of self
The self of X is the /set/ of everything that X controls.
Therefore, because selves are sets, they can intersect and join.
This is an ordinary set theory in mathematics.

If there is an overlap between what A controls and what B controls,
then they /share/ that overlapping part of their selves.
That overlapping part is a /joint/ self.

The size of self may vary over time.

Selves may /merge/ and /split/.
When I'm using a computer, some of the computer's self and some of my self /merge/ into a bigger self.
When I'm not using the computer, our selves /split/.

If I sever my hand, then that hand ceases to be a part of my self, because I can no longer control it.
If I reattach it, it becomes a part of my self again, although I may not control it as well as before.

*** TODO What is the relationship between control, causality, agency, subject, and subjective experience?
*** TODO For us to determine the size of the self of a system, some its output must /feed back/ into some of its input, so that we can distinguish what it can control and what it can't.
*** TODO Our definition of "self" generalizes its dictionary meaning.
**** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self
- "The self is an individual person as the object of his or her own reflective consciousness.
  This reference is necessarily subjective, thus self is a reference by a subject to the same subject.
  The sense of having a self – or self-hood – should, however, not be confused with subjectivity itself."
- "The first-person perspective distinguishes self-hood from personal identity.
  Whereas "identity" is sameness, self-hood implies a first-person perspective."
**** Dictionary definitions of "self" assume too much.
- <2018-11-05> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/self#Noun
  - "The subject of one's own experience of phenomena: perception, emotions, thoughts."
  - "An individual person as the object of his own reflective consciousness (plural selves)."

  - "A person's essential being that distinguishes them from others, especially considered as the object of introspection or reflexive action."
** Volition, imagination, hallucination, illusion, delusion, and intrusive thoughts
<2018-11-07>
The difference between imagination and hallucination is /voluntary of existence/.
We can start imagining at will.
We can stop imagining at will.
We cannot start hallucinating at will.
We cannot stop hallucinating at will.
"At will" means "voluntarily", that is, "by volition".

Example.
I can imagine an elephant for three seconds, and then stop imagining it.
But, if I eat a psychedelic mushroom,
I can't stop the hallucination by sheer will,
but eventually my brain chemistry returns to normal and the hallucination ends.

Imagination: mind affects brain.
Hallucination: brain affects mind.

This explains why people can't die /just by wanting/ to die:
because the mind does not fully control the brain.

How do we complete this table?

|                    | can we start it at will? | does it require our will (conscious mental effort) to start? | can we stop it at will? | origin |

*** Autonomous nervous system is not part of mind
Consider my ANS (autonomic nervous system).

My brain controls my ANS.
My mind does not control my ANS (I don't know how).

Thus, my ANS is a part of /my brain's/ self, but my ANS is not a part of /my mind's/ self.

However, both my mind and my brain are parts of /my/ self.

My mind has only very small control over my brain.
The involuntary processes are much bigger than the voluntary processes.

- This article makes me sure that
  I'm not interested in how to measure consciousness,
  I'm not interested in neural correlates of consciousness,
  and I'm not interested in neuroscience.
- Consciousness research is multidisciplinary.
  - "Cognitive scientists and neuroscientists agreed that the philosophical problems of why and how there is consciousness are also their problems.
    Philosophers agreed that empirical evidence may resolve or at least influence this debate.
    Scientists across disciplines generally agree that consciousness is subjective, characterized by a kind of privileged first-person access."
- Challenges
  - "One major obstacle for consciousness research is the lacking consensus of how to optimally measure consciousness empirically."
  - "Another major challenge is how to identify neural correlates of consciousness."
- "The future challenges"
  - "One major future challenge will be how to measure consciousness 'from the outside'."

    - "One open question regarding the nature of the mind is the mind–body problem, which investigates the relation of the mind to the physical brain and nervous system."
    - "Dualism and monism are the two major schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem."
      - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism
      - "Dualism is the position that mind and body are in some way separate from each other."
      - "Substance dualists argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas"
      - "Property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but that it is not a distinct substance."
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_dualism
      - "Monism is the position that mind and body are not physiologically and ontologically distinct kinds of entities."
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-aspect_theory
          - "[...] double-aspect theory is the view that the mental and the physical are two aspects of, or perspectives on, the same substance. It is also called dual-aspect monism."
        - "Physicalists argue that only the entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that the mind will eventually be explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues to evolve."
          - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism
          - "Many modern philosophers of mind adopt either a reductive or non-reductive physicalist position"
            - "Reductive physicalists assert that all mental states and properties will eventually be explained by scientific accounts of physiological processes and states."
            - "Non-reductive physicalists argue that although the brain is all there is to the mind, the predicates and vocabulary used in mental descriptions and explanations are indispensable, and cannot be reduced to the language and lower-level explanations of physical science."
        - "Idealists maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind."
          - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism
        - "Neutral monists adhere to the position that perceived things in the world can be regarded as either physical or mental depending on whether one is interested in their relationship to other things in the world or their relationship to the perceiver."
          - "Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects."

      - mind-body problem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem
        - "The mind–body problem is a philosophical problem concerning the relationship between thought and consciousness in the human mind and the brain as part of the physical body.
          It is distinct from the question of how mind and body function chemically and physiologically since that question presupposes an interactionist account of mind-body relations."

- We are interested in the intension.
- Is it even possible to test the intension?
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness][WP:Hard problem of consciousness]]

**** Examples of intensional consciousness vs extensional consciousness?
- Intensional but not extensional: a person playing dead.
- Extensional but not intensionally: a rule-based system with very many rules
  but never changes (doesn't have memory, doesn't learn).
  - Why isn't it intensionally conscious? It displays complex behavior.
    - Also, for every test it fails, we can always add a rule.
    - We can also add rules to make it behave as if it were self-aware.

*** Things I'm no longer interested in
**** How do we measure consciousness?
- Infer: Degree of consciousness is a continuum.
  - Assume: I was conscious when I wrote this.
  - Assume: There was a time after I was born but before I became conscious.
  - Assume: There isn't any point in time when I suddenly become conscious.
  - [[https://www.quora.com/Do-babies-have-consciousness][Quora: Do babies have consciousness?]]

**** Memory is unreliable.
***** Observe: There exists things I experienced but don't remember.
- Example: What I ate some long time ago.
***** How far back does our memory extend?
- Human memory is unreliable.
- I don't remember being a fetus in the womb.
- I don't remember being a baby.
- I vaguely remember my kindergarten when I was 3 years old.
  I'm not sure I remember it correctly.
  I don't remember anything that happened before I was 3 years old.
- I don't remember what I ate two days ago. I rarely even remember what I ate yesterday.
- I don't exactly remember what I wrote yesterday.
- I only remember a very tiny amount of everything that I perceive (everything that interacts with my senses).
***** What does it mean to remember?
- If one does not remember a thing, it does not mean that he does not have any memory about that thing.
***** How do we remember things?
- Hebbian learning? Long-term potentiation?
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_potentiation
- The only way to remember something non-traumatic is to repeat it periodically until it is in the long term memory.

*** TODO Ruminations about control
Example.
A feedback system /controls/ its output?
I don't /control/ what you say but I /control/ my emotion.
Who is /in control/?
The situation is getting /out of control/?
I /control/ the character's motions using this /controller/.

"Control [...] is a word with diverse meanings and applications,
ranging from those found in control theory regarding dynamical systems,
self-control of one's own behavior,
social control of processes and political mechanisms that regulate individual and group behaviour,
including security controls against perceived or unperceived dangers,
mind control,
in which groups or individuals systematically use unethically manipulative methods to direct others,
and scientific control to isolate variables in experiments." https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Control

Control is going against nature?
How can we go against nature if we are part of nature?
How can nature go against nature?

Control is making something go against what it would go when left alone.

Control is limit.

Control is giving commands.

"To control" means "To exercise influence over; to suggest or dictate the behavior of" according to [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/control#Verb][Wiktionary]].
Thus X controls Y iff X influences Y's behavior.

What is "influence"?
**** Failed ruminations
***** X /controls/ Y iff X does what Y /wants/ X to do.
I control something iff it does what I want.

Problematic consequence of that definition:
If, by luck, Y happens to be already doing what X wants, then the definition says that X controls Y.
Example: If I want you to do what you do, the definition says I control you.
