* Goal

The goal is to make /the/ programming language.

/The/ ultimate best programming language?

** What is programming language research for?

A goal of programming language research is to make a better programming language (if not the best).
Do more with less.

** Envisioned usage?

- Suprastructure software engineer captures business logic into high-level program.
  - Source code should be human-readable article.
  - This steps focuses on describing what things exist and the relationships between them.
  - This steps focuses on modeling.
- Infrastructure software engineer maps high-level languages to low-level languages.
  - Example of low-level programming language: Java, C#, C++, C, SQL, Scheme, Lisp, Haskell.
  - This steps focuses on the modeling language.
- some mention of "suprastructure" and "infrastructure" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_architecture

* Modeling all data

** Hypothesis: data = ADTs + records + row polymorphism

Hypothesis: All data can be modeled by a combination of these:

- product (tuple)
- sum (alternative, union)
- record (tuple with named components)
- row polymorphism

Can we use web standards to define an ontology (so we can use Protege to edit it)?
https://protege.stanford.edu/

* Basic ontology of programming

A /language/ is something that has syntax (form) and semantics (meaning).

A language enables its users to /communicate/ with each other.

A language is formed by the agreements of its users.

A /formal language/ ...

A /programming language/ is a formal language that is used for programming (a machine).

To program a machine is ...?

A /program/ is a formula/string/term in a programming language?

A machine can be modeled by a formal system.

A program is an executable mathematical object?

* Functional programming

Every functional programming language is lambda calculus plus plus.

Functional programming is lambda calculus plus plus.

* What should we know before creating a programming language?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: what-should-we-know-before-creating-a-programming-language

** Lambda calculus

Lambda calculus formalizes binding and substitution.

** Semantics

** Increasing language adoption
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: increasing-language-adoption
   :END:

In order for a language to be adopted, people must perceive its risk as low.

The language must work with existing codebases.

The language designer must think from the language user's point of view.
Let's say I have 100,000 lines of Java that I've been writing and testing for the past 5 years.
Are you expecting me throw away all of them?

Thus the language must work with C, C++, C#, Java, Go, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and everything else.
This should be possible because the essence of all programming languages is the same: every programming language is a formal system.
It should be possible to translate a program P1 in language L1 to program P2 in language L2 with the same semantics.

Improve/enhance, not supersede.

Mixing languages should be easy.

2013, article, "Empirical analysis of programming language adoption", [[http://sns.cs.princeton.edu/docs/asr-oopsla13.pdf][pdf]]

The language must be suitable for systems programming. - System programming is hardware-aware programming.
Application programming assumes abstract machine, infinite memory, and all convenience provided by the operating system. - Why do we make this distinction?

The language must facilitate metaprogramming.
Everything must be a first-class citizen.
It has to have EVAL.
The language must provide a way for interpreting/compiling/loading a program at runtime.
The compiler becomes a part of every program.

What is the reason for the name "metacircular evaluator"?
What is circular?
What is metacircular?

To make syntax first-class, we need QUOTE and UNQUOTE (such as in Lisp/Scheme)?

To prevent syntax flamewar, we should define the canonical linearization of the abstract syntax tree.
Go does this with =go fmt=.
I think that is wise.

- Basic assumptions

  - Computer (machine) is embodied formal system.

    - Assume no hardware fault.

  - Software is executable mathematics.

- [[https://www.cmi.ac.in/~madhavan/courses/pl2009/lecturenotes/lecture-notes/node28.html][Subtyping vs inheritance]]

  - Subtyping and inheritance are orthogonal concepts.

A language should provide both nominal and structural subtyping.

- 2008, "Integrating Nominal and Structural Subtyping", [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/papers/ecoop08.pdf][pdf]]

We can define structural subtyping for C structs.

We can define layout types (almost like ASN.1):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    layout {
        at byte 0;
        def var0 : little_endian int32;
        at byte 4;
        def var1 : big_endian int32;
        reserve 8 byte;
        skip 4 byte; -- synonym for reserve
        def var2 : int8;
        def var3 : array of 4 int8;
        align 16;
        def var4 : layout {
            reserve 16 byte;
            def var1 : int8;
            align 32;
        };
    }
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can define intersection, union, concatenation, and composition/nesting of two layout types.

Why don't we just build ASN.1 into the language?

* Typing records
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: typing-records
   :END:

A record type can be thought as a product type whose components are named.

If each value =valN= has type =typN=, then the record ={key1=val1; key2=val2; ...;}= has type ={key1:typ1; key2:typ2; ...;}=.
For example, the record ={name="John"; age=20}= has type ={name:String; age:Int;}=.

* Polymorphism is code generation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: polymorphism-is-code-generation
   :END:

- Consider translating =id : a -> a= to assembly.

  - If types define memory layout (bit representation), then the compiler must generate an =id= function for every =a=.
  - If the language uses runtime type tagging, then there doesn't have to be more than one=id= functions.

* Fixed points and recursive types
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: fixed-points-and-recursive-types
   :END:

A thing \( x \) is a /fixed point/ of function \( f \) iff \( f(x) = x \).

A function may have zero, one, or many fixed points.

A thing \( x : A \) is a /least fixed point/ of function \( f : A \to A \) iff
\( x \) is a minimum of the set of the fixed points of \( f \).
The words "least" and "minimum" assume an ordering \( \le \).
This ordering should be clear from context.

If \( f \) has exactly one least fixed point \( x \) with respect to ordering \( \le \), then we write \( \mu_\le(f) = x \).

The syntax \( \mu a. b \) means \( \mu_\le(\lambda a. b) \).
The syntax \( \mu a. b \) is analogous to lambda expression syntax \( \lambda a. b \).

What is the ordering used in formulating the least fixed point of a recursive algebraic data type?

Do you know of anything that computes (generates code for) the products/sums of data-types?
Do you know of any libraries that enable us to describe how to transform a data type to a related data type?
Do you know of anything resembling template metaprogramming for Haskell that is not Template Haskell?
For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    data A = A1 | A2
    data B = B1 | B2

    -- <input>
    generate data P = A * B
    generate data S = A + B
    -- </input>

    -- <output>
    data P  = P_A1_B1
            | P_A1_B2
            | P_A2_B1
            | P_A2_B2

    data S  = S_A1 | S_A2

** What is a type? Understanding what a type is from how it is used
Mathematically, A type is a set whose membership is syntactically decidable.

Engineeringly, A type gives meaning to bit patterns.

A type encodes meaning into bit patterns.
    - For example, consider the bit pattern 11111111.
        - It means -1 as an int8.
        - It means 127 as an uint8.
    - Types help translate programs.

Type system helps machines help us.
We shouldn't focus on type systems.
We should focus on logic.
We should focus on making machines help us.
The question is not how to make a good type system.
The question is how to offload the job as much as possible from humans to machines.

A programming language is a formal system.
A type system is a formal system.
Therefore a type system is a formal system embedded in a bigger formal system that is a programming language.

Programming languages have semantics, even if it is implicit.

A type defines the memory layout (bit pattern) of its values.

A type constrains values and expressions.

A type determines what values a function can take/give.

There are also other uses of types.

The question is: What is a type?
What principles should we follow when we design a language?

** Row polymorphism
Why is it called row polymorphism?
Where is the row?
See "Objects and Aspects: Row Polymorphism", Neel Krishnaswami [[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~neelk/rows.pdf][pdf]]

In the following, the function =set_name_r=  is row-polymorphic.
The function =set_name_n= is not row-polymorphic.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
type Person = { name : String; age : Int; };
type Company = { name : String; location : String; };

set_name_r : String -> {name:String; r;} -> {name:String; r;};
set_name_r new_name {name=n; r;} = {name=new_name; r;};

set_name_n : String -> {name:String;} -> {name:String;};
set_name_n new_name {name=n;} = {name=new_name;};

john : Person;
john = { name="John"; age = 20; }

joe : Person;
joe = set_name_r "Joe" john;

not_person : {name:String};
not_person = set_name_n "What" john;

abc = { name="ABC"; location="1 ABC Way"; };
def = set_name_r "DEF" abc;
#+END_EXAMPLE
Without row polymorphism, we would have to write set_name twice: once for each type.

** Parametricity
- Every recursive type can be written as `mu a. F a` where F is the associated free functor?
    - Example: `List a = Fix (F a)` where `F a b = 1 + a * b`.
    - `Fix F = F (Fix F)` is the least fixed point of F.
- Why should we care about parametricity?

** Subtyping
A subtyping relation is an ordering of types.

So what? That is technically correct but that doesn't give any insights.

A subtype is an ordering that follows the Liskov substitution principle?

** Type-checking
- Every type checking algorithm is unification (logic programming).
    - If the programmer annotates a term, use that annotation.
    - If the a term is not annotated, annotate that term with a freshly generated variable.
    - Unify everything according to the typing rules.
