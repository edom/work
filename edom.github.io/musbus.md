I will need a 49-key (or 61) and a 88-key keyboard, but I need the 49-key more.
I'm looking for a keyboard package that:

- USB class compliant
- includes a USB cable
- has a socket for sustain pedal
- has a socket for expression pedal
- What is its USB socket?
- Warranty?

I've given up looking for 49-key with piano touch.

Normal price for 49-key:

- two wheels: KRp1650.
- two wheels, knobs, pads, and sliders: KRp2400.

I can reprogram my computer to translate modulation wheel data to expression.

Let X(T) be the Indonesian Tokopedia price of T in IDR divided by United States Amazon price of T in USD.
X(88-key) is much higher than X(49-key),
probably because of lower demand but higher transportation cost (it has awkward shape).

- Go to shop.
- Determine if price is normal.
- Try the stuff.
- Buy with cash.

The 49-key one is portable.
I don't need to find a bigger desk.
I will need the 88-key one for mainly piano music.

Online comparison is futile if the thing you want is not in stock at any seller.

I bought Nektar Impact GX49 for MRp1.58 because the seller happened to have it in stock.
