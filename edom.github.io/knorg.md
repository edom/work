- Knowledge should be ordered descending by importance, from the most important?
- Knowledge should be ordered ascending by verifiability, from the easiest to verify?
- Knowledge should be grouped by usefulness?
    - If both Y and Z are useful to X, then Y and Z should be put together.
- Why does someone need to know something?
    - What is all the related things that he also needs to know?
- others

- In what sequence should we present knowledge for fastest learning?
- Example of primitive life (but not survivalism?)

- information organization
    - An information is a sentence, a paragraph, a picture, or anything that helps us accomplish something.
        - Here "information" is a countable noun.
    - Informations should be grouped by the task it helps us accomplish.
        - Every task T requires a set of informations, which should be put together in one place.
        - If doing task T requires informations J and K, then J and K should be grouped together.
        - Duplication problem.
            - Suppose: both task T and task U requires information J.
            - Where should J be put?
    - The value of information J should be measured by the ratio V/E, where V is the value of the task that J helps us accomplish, and E is our effort for obtaining J.
    - Example of combinatorial explosion of categories.
        - Which should a red car be grouped together with: a red hat or a blue car?
            - Which should a big old man be grouped together with: a big old woman, a big young man, or a small old man?
- The information organization of this wiki
    - At first I tried grouping by topic.
    - Then I asked myself, "Why am I collecting this information?"
    - Then I tried grouping by project (goals).
    - I switched from lookup-oriented knowledge organization (organize knowledge for refindability (fast lookup))
    to task-oriented (goal-oriented) knowledge organization (organize knowledge by the tasks that require the knowledge).
