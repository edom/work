When we write a program,
we are actually creating a *mathematical model* of reality,
creating an implicit ontology,
defining what exist,
making simplifying assumptions,
discarding irrelevant aspects.

[Scott Hanselman: "Software doesn't work. I'm shocked at how often we put up with it."](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EverythingsBrokenAndNobodysUpset.aspx)

Programmers need to own up their mistakes, and call an error an error, not a bug.
A bug is something the programmer cannot control.
A cosmic ray strike flipping a bit in RAM is a bug.
A typo in the source code is not a bug.
