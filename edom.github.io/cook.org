* For beginners
- /Strictly follow many recipes/ and /cook many different things many times/.
- As you advance, you will magically be able to predict tastes and create your own recipes, but until that time comes, follow proven recipes.
- Cook water.
- Reheat food.
- Cook omelette (telur dadar).
- Boil egg (telur rebus).
- Saut√© vegetable (cah sayur).
- Cook beef steak.
- Cook chicken steak (boneless chicken breast).
- Steam.
* Why preheat pan (heat pan after putting in oil but before putting in food)?
- "The oil gives off visual clues telling you just when you need to start adding ingredients."[fn::https://www.reluctantgourmet.com/frying-pan-temperature-video/]
