## Why do I write?

**To connect my future self and my past self**.
Sometimes my past self makes a decision that my future self regrets.
When that happens, my future self wants to trace back
how my past self could have made such decision.

**To change the world to what I want it to be**.
I think writing is the most efficient way of
spreading information and influencing people.
Telepathic broadcasting would be more efficient,
but I don't know how to do that.
Anyway, it's up to the world
whether they want to change.

**To save your time**.
I'm happy when my writing helps you understand something faster.
