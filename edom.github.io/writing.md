## Why do I write?

**To connect my future self and my past self**.
Sometimes my past self makes a decision that my future self regrets.
When that happens, my future self wants to trace back
how my past self could have made such decision.

**To change the world to what I want it to be**.
I think writing is the most efficient way of
spreading information and influencing people.
Telepathic broadcasting would be more efficient,
but I don't know how to do that.
Anyway, it's up to the world
whether they want to change.

**To save your time**.
I'm happy when my writing helps you understand something faster.

## Architecture

Each document in this site is a living document.

## Rules

As long as this site is hosted on GitHub,
all contents in this site shall follow the
[GitHub Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/).

Ads are OK as long as they don't hamper the reading experience.
They must not slow down the page.
They must not cover the content.

Pop-ups are not OK.

Only useful information.
No filler, no rant, no hatemongering.

## Notes to self

Decision: a website, not a book.

Reason: To minimize the readers' effort.

- The technology decisions for this wiki and why:
    - Use technology that should still work at least until year 2100.
        - Use only free open-source technologies with proven maintenance track record.
        - Enable rebuilding of the website somewhere else quickly.
    - Use Jekyll-powered GitHub Pages. If GitHub screws us, we buy a new domain, move to AWS, and ask Google to reindex.
    - Use GitHub Flavored Markdown. If Jekyll screws us, we switch to Pandoc.
    - Markdown weaknesses:
        - The original Markdown doesn't have tables.
        - Proliferation of incompatible dialects.
    - Wiki vs blog, page vs post
        - A page is timeless. Its usefulness should not depend on time.
        Old pages are still useful.
        - A post is time-sensitive. Its usefulness depends on time.
        Old posts are useless.
        - Posts are good for news, updates, changelogs, diffs.
- Undigested information
