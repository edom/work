* Metric spaces
- A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(mathematics)][space]] (a mathematical space) is a set of points.
- A /point/ is an element in a set.
- "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)][Metric]]" is another term for "distance".
  - We usually write \(d(x,y)\) to mean "the /distance/ between point \(x\) and point \(y\)".
- A /metric space/ is a space and a metric.
- Relationship:
  | geometry | set theory |
  |----------+------------|
  | space    | set        |
  | point    | element    |
* Normed vector spaces
- An /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector][Euclidean vector]]/ is something with magnitude and direction.
- A /vector/ is an element of a vector space.
- Understand /scalar--vector multiplication/:
  - If \(k\) is a scalar (a real number) and \(x\) is a vector,
    then \(kx\) is a vector whose direction is the same as \(x\) but whose length is \(k\) times the length of \(x\).
- A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space][vector space]] is a set of vectors plus some structures?
- Notation
  - \(\norm{x}\) ("the norm of \(x\)") means the length of vector \(x\).
  - "Norm" means "length".
  - The /norm/ of a vector is the /length/ (the magnitude) of that vector.
- Understand vector addition.
- Understand vector negation.
- Understand point--vector addition.
  | operation   | left argument | right argument | result |
  |-------------+---------------+----------------+--------|
  | addition    | vector        | vector         | vector |
  | addition    | point         | vector         | point  |
  | subtraction | vector        | vector         | vector |
  | subtraction | point         | point          | vector |
- Derive subtraction from addition and negation.
  - Subtraction can be derived from addition and negation: \(x-y = x+(-y)\).
  - Negation: \(-x\) is something such that \(x+(-x) = 0\).
  - If \(p+v=r\), then, subtract both sides by \(v\) to get \(p=r-v\).
- See also [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)][a brief history of vectors]].
- An /Euclidean vector space/ is a set of vectors with Euclidean metric.
  A metric is a function that maps each vector to its length.
  An Euclidean metric is distance as we know it in everyday situation.
- Euclidean distance can be derived from the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem][Pythagorean theorem]]
  that relates the lengths of the sides of a right triangle.
* Relationship between metric and norm
- Because a vector can be obtained by subtracting two points:
  - A metric space can be derived from a normed vector space.
\[ d(x,y) = \norm{y-x} \]
* Relationship between spaces: embedding, projection, homeomorphism
- Understand [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_space][ambient spaces]].
- Understand /embedding/.
  - Example: A line may be embedded in a three-dimensional space.
- Understand /projection/.
  - Example: A cube may be projected onto a plane.
  - Understand that /shadows/ can be modeled by geometric projections.
- Understand /homeomorphism/.
* Circles, pi, angles, radian
- A /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle][circle]] with center \(c\) and radius \(r\)/ is \( \SetBuilder{x}{d(c,x) = r} \)
  (the set of every point whose distance from \(c\) is \(r\)).
  - A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_sector][/sector/]] is ...
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi][\( \pi \)]] is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.

  - π is sometimes approximated as 22/7.
- An [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle][/angle/]] is ...?
- An /angle/ may be thought of as one revolution, half revolution, quarter revolution, 3/4 revolution, etc.,
  but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian][/radian/]] is the natural unit for angles.
  - 360 degrees = 2π radian = 1 revolution
  - Understand [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian#Advantages_of_measuring_in_radians][why]][fn::<2020-01-26>] radian is the natural unit for angles.
- Understand that a /positive/ angle usually means /counterclockwise/ rotation.
- Circle, sector, angle, congruence
  - Consider a circle of radius \(r\).
  - Consider a sector of angle \(\alpha\) in that circle.
  - The circumference of that sector is \( r \cdot \alpha \).
  - An angle is the "radius-independent size" of a sector.

* More dimensions
** Modeling physical space as a three-dimensional Euclidean space
There are two different meanings of "space".
Physical space is often thought of as the volume occupied by objects.

Most likely, you already understand a three-dimensional Euclidean space,
because it is your internal mental model of the space around you.

An [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space][Euclidean space]] is a set of points, not a set of coordinates.

We usually draw a point as a dot, but a point is a zero-dimensional geometric object that occupies no space at all.

[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Coord_system_CA_0.svg#][This picture]] may help you visualize a three-dimensional real tuple space.
** Dimension
- The /number of dimensions/ of a space is the /maximum number of mutually orthogonal lines/ that can coexist in that space.
  - For example, we know no way to arrange more than three mutually orthogonal rulers in physical space.
    Therefore, we think our physical space has three dimensions.
- The number of dimensions of every /subset/ of \( \Real^n \) is \(n\).
  - Do not confuse embeddings and subsets.
    - \( \Real^m \) is not a /subset/ of \( \Real^n \) if \( m \neq n \).
  - We do not define \(\Real^0\).
  - We do not define the number of dimensions of the empty set.

How do we know how many /dimensions/ a space has?

We know that a space has dimension \(n\) if we cannot simultaneously place more than \(n\) mutually orthogonal lines in that space.
We infer that our space has three dimensions because we have not found how to arrange more than three mutually orthogonal lines in our space.
For example, if we pick three rulers, we can arrange them so that they are orthogonal to each other.
But, if we pick four rulers, we know no way to arrange them so that they are orthogonal to each other.
That is why we think that space is three-dimensional.
** Orthogonality, perpendicularity
How do we know that two lines are /orthogonal/?
By a protractor?

We know that two lines are orthogonal if all the four angles formed by their intersection are equal.

Other terms for "orthogonal" are "perpendicular" and "at a right angle".
** Hypersolids
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon][polygon]] (many-corner)
  → [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron][polyhedron]] (many-seat)
  → [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope][polytope]] (many-place)
- shape → solid → hypersolid
- A /line/ is \( \SetBuilder{x}{x = a + tb, ~ t \in \Real} \).
- A /hyperplane/ is \( \SetBuilder{x}{a \cdot x = b} \).
- Understand two-dimensional geometric objects: line, circle, square.
- Understand three-dimensional geometric objects: plane, sphere, cube.
- Understand higher-dimensional geometric objects: hyperplane, hypersphere, hypercube, "hyper-" + <the name of a three-dimensional object>.
* Transformations, symmetries, and invariants
** Invariants
Let \(\phi : D \to C\) be a function.

Let \(T : D \to D\) be a function, usually called a "transformation".

We say
"\(\phi\) is /unaffected/ by \(T\)"
or "\( \phi \) is /\(T\)-invariant/"
or "\( T \) is an /invariant/ (a /symmetry/) of \( \phi \)"
iff, for all \(x \in D\):
\[ \phi(x) = \phi(T(x)) \]

Here are some examples of invariants.

Let \( Tx = x + c \) represent translation.

Example:
If \(\phi(x,o,r)\) means "\(x\) is a point on a circle with center \(o\) and radius \(r\)",
then \(\phi(x,o,r) = \phi(Tx,To,r)\).
(A predicate is a function whose codomain is the set of booleans.)

Example:
If \(V\) is a vector space, then \(\SetBuilder{Tv}{v \in V} = V\).
If we follow the "auto-lifting" convention, we can write the equation more prettily as \( TV = V \).

Example:
Even functions exhibit mirror symmetry.
(A function \( f \) is /even/ iff \( f(x) = f(-x) \) for all applicable \(x\).)

Example:
Periodicity is a special case of translation-invariance.
(A function \(f\) has /period/ \(p\) iff \(p\) is the smallest positive number such that \( f(x+p) = f(x) \) for all applicable \(x\).
A function is /periodic/ iff it has a period.)
** Symmetries
Example: let \(S\) be the set of points of an unlabeled square.

Let \(T\) be a rotation about the square's center by a right angle.

We write \(TS\) to mean "the result of rotating \(S\) about its center by a right angle".

We write \(TS = S\) to mean "rotating \(S\) about its center by a right angle produces \(S\) itself".
