## Why do I write?

### To connect my future self and my past self

Sometimes my past self makes a decision that my future self regrets.
When that happens, my future self wants to trace back
how my past self could have made such decision.

### To change the world

I think writing is the most efficient way of
spreading information and influencing people.
(Telepathic broadcasting would be more efficient,
but I don't know how to do that.)
