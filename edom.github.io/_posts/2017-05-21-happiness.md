Happiness = Reality - Expectation.

To be more happy, raise reality, lower expectation, or do both.

Pain also reduces happiness.

Money cannot buy happiness,
but it can buys things that will make you happier.

Money helps, but after you have enough to make your life comfortable,
adding money doesn't add happiness.
