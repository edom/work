- Some branches of philosophy
    - Epistemology (how do we know?)
    - Ontology (what exists?)
    - Ethics (morality; what should be?)
- Epistemology
    - There are two kinds of knowledge: *prior* and *posterior*.
        - Prior (before-the-fact) knowledge is obtained by inferring theorems from axioms through the rules of logic.
        - Posterior (after-the-fact) knowledge is obtained by observation from the real world through the physical senses.
