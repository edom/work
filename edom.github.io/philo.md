- Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that deals with the question "How do we know that we know?"
    - There are two kinds of knowledge: *prior* and *posterior*.
        - Prior (before-the-fact) knowledge is obtained by inferring theorems from axioms through the rules of logic.
        - Posterior (after-the-fact) knowledge is obtained by observation from the real world through the physical senses.
