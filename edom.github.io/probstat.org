"Probstat" is "probability and statistics".

- Basic probability modeling

  - Model coins and dices, both fair and biased, and combination
  - Multiple coin tosses
  - Conditional probability
  - Bayes rule

    - Sensitivity and specificity
    - False positive and false negative
    - Testing the test

  - Counting exhaustively

    - Monty Hall problem
    - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_or_girl_paradox][WP: Boy-or-girl paradox]] (need unambiguous problem statement)

  - Basic combinatorics (counting combinations)
  - Randomness

- Basic statistics

  - Collection? Dataset? Sample?
  - Variable vs parameter
  - Collect data
  - Design a survey

    - Avoid leading questions ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_question][WP]])
    - Avoid loaded questions ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_question][WP]])

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_data_type][WP: Statistical data type]]
  - Calculate descriptive statistics

- More rigor

  - Measure theory
  - Continuous probability

- Where should these be? How should we organize this?

  - Determining coin fairness
  - Random variable

    - Not a variable, and not random?

  - Inferential statistics

    - Infer something about the population from samples.
    - How do we sample the population correctly?
    - Case study: election "quick count" or "exit poll"

  - Estimation

    - Bias
    - Point estimation
    - Likelihood

      - Maximum likelihood estimation?

  - Fitting

    - Consider replacing "regression" with "fitting".
    - Line fitting with one independent variable

  - Random process
  - Random walk
  - Stochastic integral
  - Markov process
  - How do we interpret very small probabilities?
  - Expectation, expected value
  - Distribution
  - Normal distribution
  - Central limit theorem
  - Renewal theory
  - Decision theory

  - Probability, statistics, sample, and population

    - Probabilistic modeling: assume population, infer sample
    - Inferential statistics: gather sample, infer population

    - Probability looks to the future. Statistics looks to the past.

      - Just like finance and accounting.

** Monty Hall problem
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: monty-hall-problem
   :END:

There are three doors.
Let the set of doors be ( D = { 1, 2, 3 } ).
One door $p$ has the prize.
The other two doors $q, r$ have nothing.

The host knows which is which. The contestant doesn't.

The host asks the contestant to pick a door.

The contestant chooses a door $c$.

The host opens another door $e$ (empty) that is neither $c$ (your choice) nor $p$ (the prize).
Formally, ( e \in D - { c, p } ).
Remember that sets don't care how many times an element occurs: ( { a,a } = { a } ).

The host asks the contestant whether he wants to switch (to the door that is neither $c$ nor $e$).

Should the contestant switch?

Yes.

A calculation is in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem][WP: Monty Hall problem]].
** Randomness
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: randomness
  :END:

"Random" means "we don't know why".

We see randomness because we ignore details.

Randomness is due to the details ignored by our models.

Coin tosses are unpredictable,
but the /statistics/ of coin tosses is predictable.

*** Example of "random" in English

   :END:

"The software crashes randomly." means "We don't know why it crashes."
There /is/ a cause, but we're ignoring it.
