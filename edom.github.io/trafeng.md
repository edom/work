# Traffic engineering

- Everyone has different willingness for travel.
    - Some travel is necessary.
        - Travel to work. Travel to make economic transactions.
        - This is ideally as efficient and fast as possible.
        - This forms the inelastic baseline demand.
    - The rest of travel is discretionary.
        - Travel to leisure.
        - This is ideally as enjoyable as possible.
        - This forms the elastic demand.
- Is induced demand theory correct?

            - Counterintuitive
                - If road demand already exceeds supply, then widening roads increases traffic and causes more congestion.
