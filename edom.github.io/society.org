#+TITLE: Toward an abundant society
#+DATE: 2020-01-20 00:00:00 +0700
* Overview
- Abundance does not always mean producing more.
- Abundance sometimes means getting satisfied with less.
- Our goal is not isolation, but to establish an abundance mindset
  so that everyone follows what excites them most (what they /truly/ want to do).
  Then, people will have wealth (satisfaction) without money, and then they will value money less.
* Step 1: Pilot project: Feeding
** Overview
- I have an idea similar to The Venus Project, but more realizable and with smaller scope.
- This pilot project aims to determine whether it is possible for one man to feed himself with 100 m2
  low-tech low-effort ecological engineering (permaculture, do-nothing farming).
- At first, only some people can participate; otherwise the seed will be destroyed before it blossoms.
  Later, the environment should help more people progress spiritually.
** Determine whether it is possible in theory
- Calculate how much land can produce per square meter in normal condition with minimal maintenance.
** Legal hedging
*** What
- https://www.hukumonline.com/klinik/detail/lt5227cf20c83a3/persyaratan-untuk-membuka-perkebunan-kecil
- tricky shit http://bali.tribunnews.com/2015/08/24/awas-terjebak-urusan-izin-kavling-tanah-milik-sendiri-tak-bisa-urus-imb
- Check Badan Pertanahan Nasional, Dinas Tata Kota, rencana pembangunan, etc.
- Read UU Agraria.
- Find out whether private irrigation is illegal.
- Is it illegal if wind blows seeds from my land to someone else's land and it grows there?
*** Dasar-dasar hukum pertanahan
- UU 5/1960 tentang peraturan dasar pokok-pokok agraria (UUPA)
  - masih berlakukah?
- https://www.slideshare.net/leksnco/20140930-presenting-lekscos-team-on-legal-training-hukum-online-dasar-dasar-hukum-pertanahan-by-eddy-leks
- UUPA 7: "Untuk tidak merugikan kepentingan umum maka pemilikan dan penguasaan tanah yang melampaui batas tidak diperkenankan."
*** Kerumitan PT beli tanah
(doesn't matter; I'm not establishing a company.)

- PT tidak bisa punya Hak Milik atas tanah; hanya bisa punya HGB/HGU/Hak Pakai.
  - http://www.legalakses.com/tips-membeli-tanah-dan-bangunan-oleh-perusahaan-perseroan-terbatas-pt/
- ada batas luas kepemilikan tanah

** Find, buy, and fence a patch of land satisfying these criteria
- Can use real-estate agents or online marketplaces; or survey some unknown/unsurveyed land / terra incognita.
*** Biogeochemical cycle
- The land must be a part of a life-conducive /biogeochemical cycle/;
  sufficient in common limiting nutrients such as phosphate and rare-earth minerals.
- The land must have enough water:
  at least one of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_stream][perennial stream]], perennial rainfall (is there such thing?), or groundwater.
  - That Wikipedia article gives some hints on how to test whether a stream is perennial: see the indicators.
  - Can groundwater/aquifer water plant (like potatos, not rice field / sawah)?
- [[https://simple.wikibooks.org/wiki/World_History/Ancient_Mesopotamia][Mesopotamia]][fn::<2020-01-21>]
  "was a good place to start a civilisation because it had /fertile farmland/ and /water from the rivers/ to provide transportation and a water source."
  (emphasis mine)
- [[https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-place-geographically-to-start-a-new-civilization/answer/Zachary-Newell-1][Zachary Newell's answer]]
- Soil important parameters: water retention; damp but not waterlogged?
*** Other requirements
- Area and shape requirements:
  - The land must have an area of at least 100 m2 and at most 10,000 m2.
    Too small, not enough production.
    Too big, the man may be unable to defend.
  - The land should be encloseable/fenceable.
  - The land should be square-shaped.
- must have some support systems and be not too far from civilization
  - must be adjacent to a river that is unpolluted and will not be polluted
    - (Is private irrigation illegal?)
  - must have fertile soil (subsumed by biogeochemical cycle requirement above)
  - must be adjacent to public road (or not gravel road)
  - not too far from warteg/food seller
- low disaster risk
  - not affected by landslide, forest fires and their smoke, etc.
  - occasional earthquakes are OK, but not soil liquefaction
  - far enough (at least 5 km) from terrorist nests,
    things that may explode (chemical factories, oil rigs, bomb-making terrorist villages),
    xenophobes/radical-Muslims/anti-Chinese
    - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Tianjin_explosions][Tianjin explosion]]
      [fn::<2020-01-21> "Apartment blocks 2 km (1.2 mi) from the site sustained shattered glass, loss of roof tiles and damage to ceilings"]
      blast radius exceeds 2 km.
  - floods?
  - not near/among low-vibration people such as religious extremists and gratuitous thiefs
- Nice to haves (optional criteria, OK if not satisfied)
  - Should not too close to any mosques. (Noise issues.)
  - Does not have to be in Jakarta or even in Indonesia.
  - Should be close to forest/woodlands and metal ores?
** Find a vehicle satisfying these criteria
- must have sufficient space for clothes, tools, dry food, and water
- must install kawat-nyamuk for all openable rear passenger windows, for sleeping in vehicle
- should be able to carry building materials (which ones?)

* Step 2: Developing
** Engineer the ecology

** TODO Grow some bioindicators? How do we test soil quality? By trying to grow a cheap plant (such as grass) on it first.
Which ones?
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioindicator
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_species

Guard plant
Sentinel plant
Indicator plant
pH indicator plant

** Procedures, instructions, steps, planting times, what to plant, for beginner

  - too much hassle
** TODO Alat-alat / tools
- spade, sekop
- sepatu bot
- meteran
- tong sampah bertutup untuk kompos; atau turnable compost bin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVVokyVZQHE
  - atau pakai gentong nganggur di dapur
- gerobak, trolley, wheelbarrow
- sarung tangan kebun (bukan sarung tangan medis latex yang di apotik); reusable garden gloves, not use-once throw-away medical gloves
- masker
- pitchfork/rake, to turn over compost
- semprotan / spray / atomizer
- soil thermometer
- (no longer applies) pot tanaman, tapi jangan terlalu besar; pastikan orang masih bisa angkat pot itu dengan isinya
- hose
- trash can / recycle bin / compost bin
- Waterproof/weatherproof/Heavy-duty/Industrial/Durable labels; what do you call it?
- manual seeder / hand-cranked seeder; can use a box/container/bottle with some small holes, and shake it; or just use the hand
  - mix the seed randomly, and sow them, because Nature knows best; can use
** More
- Install solar electric generators.
- Build a house/shelter/settlement.
  - Prefab?
  - Must have walls and roofs.
- Permaculture (do-nothing-farm) the land.
- Prevent malaria.
- The worst thing that could happen is that we become more resilient against money;
  our land will always feed us even if the value of money plummets to hell.
* Step 3: Attracting high-vibration people
- Probably retirees.
* Step 4: Attracting and helping low-vibration people
* Other people's projects
