- [Wiktionary:etymology of "model"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/model#Etymology)
- A model of \\( A \\) is a simplified representation of \\( A \\).
    - To model something is to choose which aspects to care about. All other aspects are ignored.
    - [WP:Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model)
- A model is a simplified description of reality?
    - A description of reality is not reality.
        - If reality and theory disagree, then reality wins and theory must change.

    - In [The Relativity of Wrong](http://chem.tufts.edu/answersinscience/relativityofwrong.htm), Isaac Asimov writes
        - Asimov's relativity of wrong:
            - Both round earth theory and flat earth theory are wrong,
            - but believing that they are equally wrong is wronger than both of them combined.

    - How many parameters do we need to model a system?
    - Discrete Newtonian kinematical model
        - A *system at time \\( t \\)* is a set of particles <span>\( \{ 1, \ldots, n \} \)</span>.
            - Time is a real number: \\( t \in \Real \\).
            - The number of particle is constant \\( n \in \Nat \\).
            - For each particle \\( k \\):
                - It has *position* \\( x_k \in \Real^3 \\).
                - Simplifying assumptions
                    - particle
                        - It is a point.
                            - It doesn't occupy any space.
                        - Its mass is not modeled.
                    - Time is global and absolute (the same everywhere).
    - Discrete Newtonian dynamical model (N-body problem) extends discrete Newtonian kinematical model.
        - A *system at time \\( t \\)* is all that above, plus:
            - For each particle \\( k \\):
                - It has *mass* \\( m_k \in \Real \\).
                - It has *resultant force* \\( F_k \\) acting on it.
                - Simplifying assumptions about the particle
                    - It is rigid.
                        - It doesn't deform.
                        - It doesn't break.
                    - Its mass is constant.
                    - It don't interact with other particles.
                        - Particles don't merge or collide.
