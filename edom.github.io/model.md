- [Wiktionary:etymology of "model"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/model#Etymology)
- A model of \\( A \\) is a simplified representation of \\( A \\).
    - To model something is to choose which aspects to care about. All other aspects are ignored.

- On being wrong
    - ["All models are wrong, but some are useful."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong), George Edward Pelham Box (1919--2013)
    - In [The Relativity of Wrong](http://chem.tufts.edu/answersinscience/relativityofwrong.htm), Isaac Asimov writes
    "[...] John, when people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together."
- Physical modeling
    - In Newtonian mechanics, a particle is modeled as \\( (m,x) \\) where \\( m \\) is its mass
    and \\( x(t) \\) is its position at time \\( t \\).
        - Is \\( x \\) a real number or a real function?
        - Is it a particle or the evolution of a particle?
            - Does "the same particle at different times" make sense?
                - What is "same"?
                    - Can we go on without answering this question?
