- [Wiktionary:etymology of "model"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/model#Etymology)
- A model of \\( A \\) is a simplified representation of \\( A \\).
    - To model something is to choose which aspects to care about. All other aspects are ignored.

    - ["All models are wrong, but some are useful."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong), George Edward Pelham Box (1919--2013)
    - In [The Relativity of Wrong](http://chem.tufts.edu/answersinscience/relativityofwrong.htm), Isaac Asimov writes
    "[...] John, when people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together."

        - A *system at time \\( t \\)* is a set of particles <span>\( \{ 1, \ldots, n \} \)</span>.
            - Time is a real number: \\( t \in \Real \\).
            - The number of particle is constant \\( n \in \Nat \\).
            - For each particle \\( k \\):
                - It has *mass* \\( m_k \in \Real \\).
                - It has *position* \\( x_k \in \Real^3 \\).

                    - It is a point.
                        - It doesn't occupy any space.
                    - It is rigid.
                        - It doesn't deform.
                        - It doesn't break.
                        - It doesn't merge with other particles.
                        - It doesn't collide with other particles.
                        - Its mass is constant.
