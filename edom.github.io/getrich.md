- What is money?
    - Money is a way for people to decide what is important (vote for what is important).
        - People vote with their money.
- The job of a company (a company director?) is to find what to do and find who should do it.
    - Everyone has different tendencies, strengths, weaknesses, desires, preferences, habits, upbringings, backgrounds.
    - Some people are more suited for some jobs.
        - Some jobs require high IQ; otherwise the employee will take too long to learn.
        - Some jobs require low IQ; otherwise the employee will get bored too soon.
            - Yes, low IQ can be a strength.
    - The company has goals.
    - The director breaks down the goals into jobs.
    - The director matches employees and jobs.
    - Which comes first: the job or the employee?
        - Do you formulate a job description first, and then find people to do that?
        - Do you hire people first, and then formulate jobs suitable for them?
    - A good company accomplishes more than each employee can accomplish individually.

            - The 21st century way of living is radically different.
            Different ideas of freedom.
                - In the post-Westphalian worldview, freedom means sovereignty, being autonomous, being an island.
        - Second Industrial Revolution teaches kids to be factory workers. Obedient. Unquestioning. Hardworking.

    - Corporates were invented by aristocrats to make sure peasants stay peasants?
    - [transcript](https://bigthink.com/videos/douglas-rushkoff-on-the-internet-and-the-future-of-business)
        - We should verify and distill these texts.
        These are some bold claims.
            - "As the peasants became wealthy the aristocracy got scared, who are these people?
            They're not going to be dependent on us any more.
            So they came up with two main financial innovations to prevent the rise of this peer to peer economy.
            The first one was the chartered monopoly, really the parent to the modern corporation.
            All the chartered monopoly was was a way to say all of you small businesses are now illegal.
            If you want to be in the shoe business you have to work for his majesty's royal shoe company.
            You want to be in the grain business you have to work for his majesty's royal grain company.
            So people who were small business people now became employees.
            Instead of selling the value they created, now they sold their time as servants, as wage laborers."
            - "The second invention they came up with was central currency.
            Not such a terrible thing in itself.
            It's great to have a long distance currency that lots of people can use and value, but the problem was they made all of the local currencies illegal.
            So the only way people could trade with each other, the candlestick maker could trade with the chicken farmer was by borrowing central currency from the treasury.
            So now you had to borrow money at interest just in order to transact.
            And that set in motion really a growth cascade.
            If you have a currency that has to be paid back with interest, in order to just make end meet you need an economy that's growing.
            You need more money next year than there was this year."
            - "So that worked well for colonial powers, as long as we could extend into Africa and South America and North America, find slaves, find new resources, we could grow.
            But what happens when you reach the end of the planet's growth as we did really at the end of World War II?"

- Work-life balance?
    - Life *is* work.
    - Your work defines you.
    You are only as good as your contribution to the world.
    Your work defines the meaning of your life.
    - Don't confuse working with employment.
        - Work is everything that creates value.
        - Employment is just a kind of work.
    - Don't confuse being busy and working.
        - Work should create value.
        - You can feel busy while not producing anything.
        - Work has goals. Being busy doesn't have goals.
    - People don't care about processes.
    They only care about results.
    - If you are not working in all your waking hours, then it's not the work you want.
    - If I could work in my sleep, I would!
- Transport is waste.
Hence travel is waste.
- Why can't people stay at home on holidays?
    - If you don't like staying at home on holidays, that means something is wrong with your home.
    Fix it.
    Make it the best place on Earth.
    Face reality.
    Don't escape.

- Communism
    - The USSR was beyond communism; it was Stalinism.
    - Stalinism failed because it overcentralizes power.
        - Power corrupts.
        - Oppression isn't a good long-term strategy.
        - People are like gas.
            - Increasing pressure (oppression, stress, overcrowding) increases temperature (collisions, friction, conflicts, clashes).
    - People would still work even if they couldn't get rich.
        - People work to give their life meaning, not to get rich.
            - Getting rich is a side-effect.
        - Would they work better if they could get rich?
- If you buy land and let it idle, only to sell it higher in the future, then you're *seeking rent*.
    - You are not creating any value.
    You burden society.
    You get rich by burdening others, making them poorer.
    The world is better without you.
    You contribute to city sprawl, which causes winding roads, more fuel consumption, more traffic, more pollution, and more heat.
    You should be heavily taxed for the huge negative externality you cause.
- Is all speculation rent-seeking?
