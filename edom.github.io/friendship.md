# Abstract

Your friends are those who will sacrifice for you.
The greater the sacrifice, the greater the friendship.

# Measure

We define \\(F(A,B)\\), the *friendship measure from A to B*
as how much sacrifice that A is willing to make for B;
therefore the problem of measuring friendship boils down
to the valuation of sacrifices.

The easiest (but not necessarily the best) way to approximate
the amount of that sacrifice
is by calculating its approximately equivalent amount of money.
Of course friendship will involve sacrificing a lot of other things beside money,
but we can approximate the value of all those things with money.

# Properties

Friendship is circumstantial.
\\(F(A,B)\\) changes over time.

Friendship is usually asymmetric.
It is usually the case that \\(F(A,B) \neq F(B,A)\\).

# Measuring

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_technique">Foot-in-the-door</a>:
let A ask B to make bigger and bigger sacrifices until B refuses.
Then we have found \\(F(A,B)\\).

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door-in-the-face_technique">Door-in-the-face</a>:
let A ask B to make a sacrifice so big that B refuses,
and then let A ask B to make smaller and smaller sacrifices until B accepts.
Then we have found \\(F(A,B)\\).

Those results may differ, but \\(F(A,B)\\) should lie somewhere between those two points.
We can also average them, take the maximum, take the minimum,
use interval arithmetics,
or describe the result using a statistical distribution, for example.

Note: running those procedures may have consequences to your friendship.
If you want to measure your friendship, you should measure it unconspicuously.
