## Abstract

Your friends are those who sacrifice for you.
The greater the sacrifice,
the greater the friendship.
How do we measure a sacrifice?

## Measurement in theory

We define \\(F(A,B)\\) (the *friendship measure from A to B*)
as how much sacrifice that A is willing to make for B.

(Is the direction correct? Is that backwards?)

Thus measuring friendship boils down to valuating sacrifices.

\\( F(A,B) \\) can be approximated by an equivalent amount of money.

## Measurement in practice

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_technique">Foot-in-the-door</a>:
let A ask B to make bigger and bigger sacrifices until B refuses.
Then we have found \\(F(A,B)\\).

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door-in-the-face_technique">Door-in-the-face</a>:
let A ask B to make a sacrifice so big that B refuses,
and then let A ask B to make smaller and smaller sacrifices until B accepts.
Then we have found \\(F(A,B)\\).

Those results may differ, but \\(F(A,B)\\) should lie somewhere between those two points.
We can also average them, take the maximum, take the minimum,
use interval arithmetics,
or describe the result using a statistical distribution, for example.

## Properties

Friendship is circumstantial:
\\(F(A,B)\\) changes over time.

Friendship is usually asymmetric:
\\(F(A,B) \neq F(B,A)\\).

## Questions

What is self-friendship?
What is \\( F(A,A) \\)?
How much is one willing to sacrifice for oneself?
Does this question even make sense?
