- ontology
    - wealth
        - *Wealth* is the sum of satisfied wants.
    - price, pay, ownership, exchange, transaction
        - To *own* something is to have exclusive access to that thing.
        - *Exchange* and *transaction* are synonyms.
        - An *exchange* is an agreement
            - between two parties A and B where
                - A gives X to B,
                - B gives Y to A.
        - If X is money and Y is not money, then:
            - X is the price.
                - *Price* is the amount agreed for exchange.
                - *Price* is something sacrificed to get something else.
            - A is the buyer.
            - B is the seller.
            - The buyer *pays* the price to the seller.
    - negotiation, price-taker, price-maker
        - Negotiating parties often have asymmetrical bargaining power.
        - The price-taker is the weaker one.
        - The price-maker is the stronger one.
    - money and currency
        - Money has *currency* and *amount* (*magnitude*).
        - Money can be *exchanged* with many other things.
    - debt, interest, and price
        - The price of debt is the *interest*
        (the amount of money that will be exchanged for obtaining the loan now).
            - An X market is a market where X is traded.
                - A money market is a market where money is traded.
                    - How do you buy money with money?
- Assumptions
    - Every human:
        - Has wants.
        - Has priorities? Utility function?
            - Non-constructive? It exists, but we don't know what it is?
        - Acts to satisfy those wants.
- Counterexamples? Where the theory breaks down?
    - Thiefs want something more than freedom?
        - But both of the stolen thing and the freedom will be taken away?
    - Smokers and junk food eaters don't want health?
        - Everybody wants health?
            - But doesn't behave consistent with wants?
                - Cognitive dissonance?
                    - Want health later or health now?
                    - Addiction?
                        - Physical changes to the brain?
- Fundamentals of economics
    - Everybody wants something.
    - How do we satisfy more people using less resources?
- decision theory?
    - [WP:von Neumann--Morgenstern utility theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem)
- Higher-order belief
    - [WP:Keynesian beauty contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest)
    - Examples of higher-order beliefs:
        - People believe that money is valuable because they believe
        that others also believe that money is valuable.
- How do we give more than we take?
    - How do we produce more than we consume?
- Land > Labor > Capital
    - The [factors of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production)
    in classical economics are:
        - land (all other things that exist in nature),
        - labor (human),
        - capital (tools).
    - Land creates labor.
    - Labor creates capital.
    - If capital is destroyed, labor can rebuild it.
    - If labor is destroyed, capital cannot rebuild it.
    - Labor without capital is inefficient.
    - Capital without labor is _nothing_.
    - However, without land, nothing would exist at all.
    - Therefore, land is more important than labor, and labor is more important than capital,
        - but it seems here that capital is revered, labor is disdained, and land is forgotten.
    - Money is not capital, but it can be used to buy capital, but this quote is related:
> When the last tree is cut, the last fish is caught, and the last river is polluted;
> when to breathe the air is sickening, you will realize, too late,
> that wealth is not in bank accounts and that you can’t eat money.

- Is Indonesia basic income feasible?
    - [WP:Basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income)
    - [APBN 2016](https://www.kemenkeu.go.id/apbn2016) income Rp 1,822.5 trillion (in one year).
    - 2016 population 258 million people. (source?)
    - Thus about Rp 7 million per man-year.
        - This isn't even enough to buy food for one man-year.

    - Write about inflation
        - Supply-caused inflation
        - Demand-caused inflation

- philosophy
    - Increasing the wealth of the human race conflicts with antinatalism?
    - Increasing the minimum/average wealth of the human race doesn't conflict with antinatalism?
- Some economists
    - David Ricardo
    - Henry George
    - Adam Smith
    - John Maynard Keynes
- Initial money supply
    - How is money distributed for the first time (when there is not yet any money)?
    - How do we transition from barter to cash?
        - How do we set prices?
- [WP:Modern monetary theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory)?
- Tax
    - Tax enables government to redistribute money (and therefore some wealth).
    - Tax enables government to discourage the consumption of certain goods.
    - Taxation is legalized robbery.
        - The government forcibly takes some of the people's money.
        - The people doesn't get to decide what the tax money is used for.
            - The government is assumed to use that money for the people's good.
- [WP:Trickle-down economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics)
    - How does one arrive at this? How does one think? What is the argument?
- [WP:Minimum wage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage)
    - Does minimum wage hurt the same people it is supposed to help?
    - Is minimum wage about politics, not economics?
    - If worker unionization is easy, then government minimum wage is unnecessary?
    - Without minimum wage, worker unions and company unions will fight directly?
        - With minimum wage, government intermediates the fight between worker unions and company unions?
- If the total amount of money is constant,
then the only way for you to have more money
is to make someone else has less money.
    - [WP:Mercantilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism) assumes that the total wealth in the world is constant?
        - "Mercantilists viewed the economic system as a zero-sum game, in which any gain by one party required a loss by another.[16]"
- Questions I haven't been able to answer
    - If everybody needs to buy food, then why aren't farmers the richest people on Earth?
        - What if the farmers don't spend?
            - Will money collect at the farmers?
            - Will they be the richest people on Earth?
- Money circulation
    - Circulating money amount should be proportional to amount of goods/services exchanged?
    - The amount of money in circulation can be reduced by tax or destruction.
    - Why do governments sell bonds?
        - To reduce the amount of money in circulation now?
            - At the cost of increasing a bigger amount of money circulating in the future?
    - Money moves faster in certain areas?
    - How does the government increases the amount of money in circulation?
        - How I think it might be done:
            - Create new money.
            - Spend that money by buying things from a few elites,
                - with the hope that the elites will quickly spend that money to the lesser elites.
                    - Thus that money will circulate to more people.
                        - But isn't this trickle-down economics?
        - But does it even do this? Isn't it the banks?
    - What is the effect of people's borrowing from banks?
        - Increase circulating money now (boom part of boom-bust cycle).
        - Reduce *more* circulating money later (bust part of boom-bust cycle, when the loan is paid back with interest).
            - Principal plus interest (money retired) is greater than principal (money created),
            so the net effect of lending money now
            is a delayed reduction of a greater amount of money in circulation.
                - Where does the money to pay the interest come from?
                    - If left alone, eventually the money collects at the banks?
                        - But banks have expenses too.
                            - Banks need to pay taxes, pay their utility bills,
                            pay their staffs.
                        - But shouldn't the money collect at the farmers?
    - The ideal inflation rate is zero?

        - If something is profitable, someone will do it.
        - Some evil is profitable.
        - Therefore someone will do some evil and get rich from doing that evil.
