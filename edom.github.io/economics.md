## Land > Labor > Capital

The [factors of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production)
in classical economics are:

- land (all other things that exist in nature),
- labor (human),
- capital (tools).

Land creates labor.

Labor creates capital.

If capital is destroyed, labor can rebuild it.

If labor is destroyed, capital cannot rebuild it.

Labor without capital is inefficient.

Capital without labor is _nothing_.

However, without land, nothing would exist at all.

Therefore, land is more important than labor, and labor is more important than capital,
but it seems here that capital is revered, labor is disdained, and land is forgotten.

Money is not capital, but it can be used to buy capital, but this quote is related:

> When the last tree is cut, the last fish is caught, and the last river is polluted;
> when to breathe the air is sickening, you will realize, too late,
> that wealth is not in bank accounts and that you canâ€™t eat money.
