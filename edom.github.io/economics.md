Wealth is the sum of satisfied wants.

Other definition candidates of wealth:

- satisfied wants minus unsatisfied wants
- satisfied wants divided by total wants

Increasing the wealth of the human race conflicts with antinatalism.

The wealthy man is the man who needs as few things as possible,
and depends on as few people as possible.

## Fundamentals of economics

Everybody wants something.

How do we satisfy more people using less resources?

How do we produce more than we consume?

How do we give more than we take?

## Land > Labor > Capital

The [factors of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production)
in classical economics are:

- land (all other things that exist in nature),
- labor (human),
- capital (tools).

Land creates labor.

Labor creates capital.

If capital is destroyed, labor can rebuild it.

If labor is destroyed, capital cannot rebuild it.

Labor without capital is inefficient.

Capital without labor is _nothing_.

However, without land, nothing would exist at all.

Therefore, land is more important than labor, and labor is more important than capital,
but it seems here that capital is revered, labor is disdained, and land is forgotten.

Money is not capital, but it can be used to buy capital, but this quote is related:

> that wealth is not in bank accounts and that you canâ€™t eat money.

- Is Indonesia basic income feasible?
    - [WP:Basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income)
    - [APBN 2016](https://www.kemenkeu.go.id/apbn2016) income Rp 1,822.5 trillion (in one year).
    - 2016 population 258 million people. (source?)
    - Thus about Rp 7 million per man-year.
        - This isn't even enough to buy food for one man-year.
