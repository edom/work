- Android vs iPhone, from user's point of view (not developer)
    - Which company would you rather screw you?
        - Company isn't about good or bad.
            - It's about profit.
            - Everyone can make mistakes.
        - Google
            - is an advertising company
                - 96% income from online ads

        - Apple
            - is a hardware company
                - income from computers, phones, devices
                    - with handsome profit margin

        - playground analogy
            - Google is the kid who
                - has a design for big sand castle,
                - gets all the other kids to build that castle (with some strict licensing terms).
            - Apple is the kid who
                - builds the most beautiful sand castle
                - but doesn't want to play with anybody else.
    - price
        - For the same hardware specs, Android phones should be much cheaper than iPhone.
    - interoperability
        - Android phones use standard connectors (USB).
        - iPhone uses Apple-only connectors (Lightning).
            - There are adapters though, but sold separately?
            - Never expect any Apple hardware to just work with non-Apple hardware.
                - Either buy *everything* from Apple, or buy *nothing* from them.
                    - Treat Apple as a religion.
                        - You don't join a religion with half your ass. You go all-in.

    - serviceability
        - You can't open the case of an iPhone.
            - You can't replace the battery of an iPhone.
    - software
        - All popular services are likely to be available on both Android and iPhone:
        WhatsApp, Go-jek, Grab, Uber, etc.
            - Unless you're in China.
        - Android software
            - is more shitty
                - Java, bloat, no good for realtime audio
                - I bought a Samsung Galaxy Nexus in 2012.
                    - Every time I turn wifi on, the phone hangs for a minute.
                    - Every time I open Chrome after not using it for a while, the phone hangs for a minute.
            - but more varied because there are more users and developers.
        - Android has more software than iPhone,
            - but unless you have uncommon needs, both Android and iPhone should have the software.
    - App store
        - Android: app store regulated by Google but not as heavily as Apple
        - iPhone: app store heavily regulated by Apple
    - App store users
        - Android has lots of stupid users giving 1-star to an app for reasons unrelated to the app
        - iPhone users are more willing to pay than Android users
