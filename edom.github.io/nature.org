* About the book and its approach
** The approach of this book?
I am trying to justify physics.
I am trying to answer "How do we know (that atoms exist, etc.)?"

I am trying to construct a coherent narrative that will enable me to understand physics.
This narrative is not necessarily chronological.

Both theory and experiment are important, and should be balanced.
** The order of the contents of this book: The dependency graph of physical concepts?
The contents of this book are ordered ascending by knowability.

It may be beneficial to compare the sequence in this book against the sequence in other books,
such as "The Feynman lectures on physics"[fn::http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/],
and "University physics"[fn::https://openstax.org/details/books/university-physics-volume-1].

The format "A: B, C, D" means that A depends on B, C, and D,
and thus B, C, and D should precede A.

Mass: Weight.
Because weight is directly perceptible by people who grow up on Earth.

Electrochemistry: Electrostatics.

Thermionic emission: Two-charge electricity.

Electrodynamics: Electrochemistry, Battery.

Cathode rays: Thermionic emission, Electrodynamics.

Electrons: Thermionic emission.

Atomic theory: Molecules, Electrochemistry.
Because electrochemistry is the only known way to isolate many chemical elements.

Electromagnetism: Mechanics.
Because understanding electric force and magnetic force obviously requires understanding force.

Electromagnetism: Magnetostatics, electrodynamics.

Energy: Work.

Crystals: Atomic theory.

Davisson--Germer experiment: Crystals.

Quantum mechanics:
light polarization,
Franck--Hertz experiment,
Davisson--Germer experiment.

Electromagnetic waves: Fields.

Black-body radiation: Photoelectric effect.
Contrary to history, and contrary to some physics textbooks[fn::https://cnx.org/contents/rydUIGBQ@12.1:bq-wv5M8@6/Introduction],
we can use hindsight to avoid Planck's toil?

Relativity: Simultaneity, synchronization.
** Rant about the ideal education system?
In lower education,
there should not be a math class, a physics class, a chemistry class, and a biology class;
there should be only one science class.
Students may benefit more from learning those subjects concurrently than from learning them in isolation.

By philosophy, I mean applied philosophy,
especially applied epistemology and applied ontology.
By "applied", I mean using English words with their everyday meanings,
and going only as far as can be tested with the scientific method.
We assume that everyday logic holds in the world.
We assume that our senses are good enough for some scientific experiments.
We interpret the word "to know something" and "to understand something"
to mean "to have a useful internal mental model about something".

Here I try to follow Vladimir Arnold's advice in his essay "On teaching mathematics"[fn::https://www.uni-muenster.de/Physik.TP/~munsteg/arnold.html].
Particularly motivating is his comment "Mathematics is the part of physics where experiments are cheap."

How to read the book:
Mentally visualize what is evoked by the text.
Read a sentence, then visualize that sentence you have just read,
and then do the same thing with the next sentence, and so on.

This book should be read strictly sequentially,
because understanding later parts requires understanding earlier parts.
If you already know a part, you can skim it, or scan it, or glance at it, or read it quickly, just to make sure.
** Rant about typical books?
The problem with typical books is that they merely feed us with macronutrients such as information,
and not nourish us with micronutrients such as epistemology.
Those books are are nutritionally unbalanced.
They feed but they don't nourish.
They inform but they don't inspire.

(Really?)

Susan Fowler recommended[fn::https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2016/8/13/so-you-want-to-learn-physics] these books for quantum mechanics:
Griffiths's "Introduction to quantum mechanics" \cite{griffiths2005introduction}
and Sakurai's "Modern quantum mechanics" \cite{sakurai2011modern}.
She recommends these books for quantum field theories:
Anthony Zee's "Quantum field theory in a nutshell" \cite{zee2010quantum}.
Unfortunately none of them suited my wants; otherwise I would not have written this book.
** Rant about ancient philosophers?
(Can we really blame our ancestors for this?
We have hindsight; they did not.)

Perhaps the biggest misfortune of the ancient philosophers is that they thought too much and experimented too little.
Sometimes they guessed right, but most of the times their guesses were nonsensical or even misleading.
If we could go back in time and told them to balance their theorizing and experimentation,
perhaps we would have the technology to live forever by the 21st century.

But we should be wary of being too wary,
lest we become the polar opposite of those ancient philosophers;
we do not want to think too little and experiment too much.
A balance is vital.
Hypotheses should be testable, and experiments should be insightful.
Hypotheses should lead us to the next experiments,
and experiments should lead us to the next hypotheses.

But surely people have been experimenting since humans existed?[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_scientific_method]
Also, those ancient people had to invent engineering before they could do the experiments?

The science-engineering cycle:
Science enables engineering to build more advanced instruments
which enable more advanced experiments which enable more advanced science.
After scientists find a new theory, engineers make more advanced instruments.
It is getting harder to make more advanced instruments.
The scale is exponential.
Going from 10 /nanometers/ to 1 nanometer is much harder than going from 10 /millimeters/ to 1 millimeter.

Science began to take off when we began asking Nature directly instead of guessing the answers.
Experiment is the language of Nature.
To do an experiment is to ask Nature about a piece of truth.
Nature tells the same truth to everyone who asks the same question.
The only condition is that we speak Nature's language: experiments.
Perhaps our lives will take off too, when we realize that we don't know,
and we ask people questions instead of guessing the answers.

However, perhaps we have to cut our ancestors some slack.
We have the benefit of hindsight.

Indeed, if I am able to write this book only in several years,
it is because the toil of our ancestors that we do not repeat.
They planted and nurtured the tree of knowledge; I am merely harvesting the fruits.
It is only by the theories that I do not ponder and the experiments that I do not perform,
that I am able to write this book in less than a few thousand years.
** Dividing physics by scale
We can divide physics into several parts,
depending on whether the object of study is manipulable by human hands:
- physics of small objects, for objects that are too small for the human hand, such as atoms;
- physics of medium objects, for objects that are about the size of the human hand; and
- physics of large objects, for objects that are too large for the human hand, such as celestial objects.

Basically, the physics of large objects is the part of physics
that does not require the theory of atoms in order to be understood.

The physics of medium objects is easy to experiment with and verify,
and thus should motivate us to dive deeper into physics.
Hence it comes early in this book.

* Reintroduction to mathematics
** Dispelling the fear of mathematics
Fear mathematics not, because it is just abbreviated English.
For example, instead of repeating the cumbersome "where the ball is at a given time",
we may write the much shorter "\( h(t) \)".
Instead of writing the long and hard-to-parse phrase
"a number that equals zero when multiplied by itself and then subtracted by one",
we write "a number \(x\) such that \(x^2 - 1 = 0\)".

Mathematics originated as a way of modeling reality.

People did math because they wanted to do something in the real world.
Shepherds want to make sure that they don't lose cattle, so they count their cattles.
Carpenters want to cut woods for the diagonal braces of a roof, so they use the Pythagorean theorem.
Merchants want to profit, so they subtract expenses from income, and use exponentials to calculate interests.
Train operators want to profit, so they calculate the quantity of coal they should carry for a given distance.
Nations want to avoid famine, so they calculate how much crop they should plant.
And so on.
People did math to avoid wasting things.

The numerical operations used in these applications are mostly simple.
The difficulty lies in collecting the facts and justifying the assumptions
that connect the mathematical world and the physical world.
** Mathematical modeling
What is the minimum number of parameters needed to model a physical system?
How many parameters are required to capture the aspects we are interested in?

A physical theory is a combination of a mathematical model and a philosophical justification.

"How do we measure something" is an epistemological question.

The marriage between physics and mathematics has been so intimate and fruitful
that it is impossible to do any significant physics in the 21st century without mathematics.
* --- Part --- The physics of medium objects
* Matter, properties, and measurement
** Ontology: Classes, instances, and properties
"Water" is a class, a category, a concept, an idea, an abstract object.
The liquid thing in my drinking bottle is a concrete object that is an instance of the "water" concept.

We will sometimes conflate a concept and its instances.

Class property and instance property.
Example of class property: all water is clear.
Example of instance property: this bucket of water weighs 1 kg.

More properties of matter will be discussed in the "Analytical chemistry" section.
** Properties: How we know what something is
Pretend that we were our ancestors who did not know much chemistry.

How do we identify something?
By its properties.
We assume that if two things have the same properties, then they are the same thing.[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles]
For example, in 1000 BC, if something looks like water, tastes like water, flows like water,
weighs like water, then it probably is really water.
What is water?
Water is whatever that we define to have the properties of water:
clear liquid at room conditions,
weighing 1 kg per liter,
boiling at 100 deg C at sea level, and so on.
We name such thing "water".

First, we define "water" as whatever that is flowing in the nearest river.
Then we take some of that water, and experiment to find its properties, such as its color, taste, boiling point, and so on.
Then we declare that everything else that has those properties is also water.
** Properties of an object: How do we know?
We know a thing's properties through our senses and reasoning.

We don't know all properties of water,
but we know some properties to distinguish water from non-water in everyday life.

How do we know that something is water?
If it is liquid, and it comes in large amount from the sky or a river,
then it is very likely water.
But that is just a caveman heuristic, not a scientific test.
The real answer was only found in the 18th century.
Cavendish 1781 mixed "inflammable air" and "dephlogiscated air" into one container,
created an electric spark inside the container with an electrostatic machine,
and observed the formation of water.
 [fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water#History]
 [fn::http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Bo-Ce/Cavendish-Henry.html]
 [fn::http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water.html]
Back then the term "hydrogen" and "oxygen" had not been invented.
Terms like "inflammable air" suggest that people back then thought that air everywhere is the same on Earth,
and there is a recipe for turning common air into "inflammable air".

Thus, the next question is, "What properties are there?"

The properties of matter may be classified into two kinds:
physical properties[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_property]
and chemical properties[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_property],
depending on whether the property involves chemical reactions.[fn::https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_(Inorganic_Chemistry)/Chemical_Reactions/Properties_of_Matter]

Some examples of properties that are simple to observe:
color, weight, density, odor, taste, feel, texture, phase (solid or liquid).

Early analytical chemistry relies on appearance and measurements:
If it's red and it's found on the ground, we call it "copper".

Analytical chemistry[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry] tries to answer
"How do we know what something is?"
And we answered "By its properties."
Thus, analytical chemistry tries to answer the question
"What properties are there, especially, what chemical properties are there?"

Static properties: color, phase.

Dynamic properties: reactions with other things.
For example, it is a property of salt to dissolve in water.
Conversely, it is a property of water to dissolve salt.

One property alone may be insufficient to identify substances.
For example, both water and sulfuric acid is a clear liquid.
If we rely on color alone, we may accidentally drink the wrong liquid.
** Database/record of properties: Where is it?
Where is our cumulative knowledge of matter stored?

It is vital to have a record of things, their properties, and their chemical reactions ("chemical recipes").
Such information was kept in books and libraries.
In the 21st century, we have computers.

Wikipedia has some properties for some chemical substances.

Also see:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_database
** TODO What?
Substance S is something that has color C, density D, phase P at room temperature at sea level,
reacts with substance T to produce substance U, and so on.
That is, substance S is whatever that has all the supposed properties of substance S.

One way is by density.
For example, the density of water is one kilogram per liter,
so if there is one liter of liquid that weighs two kilograms,
then it may be contaminated water, or not water at all.

How do we know that two similar substances are the same substance?
All metals look shiny.
How do we tell apart silver from platinum?

A molecule?

"Chemical analysis" or "analytical chemistry"?
How do we know what something is, what is in it, what it is made of?
By a collection of classical tests[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_chemistry#Classical_methods].
But there is some risk of false positive/negative.

More sophisticated tests
 [fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry]
 [fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography]?

An observable property is a property that we can perceive with our senses.
We will only deal with properties that can be known by experiment.
** Properties: Can we know all of them?
To distinguish between two substances, we only have to find one property in which they differ.
However, to show that two substances are identical, we have to show that all their properties are the same.
But if we cannot know all properties,
then we cannot know whether two substances are identical,
but we can still hold strong beliefs.
** Weight: How do we measure it?
/Weight/ is what a weight scale[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale] measures.

One handful of iron is heavier than one handful of water.
Thus we say that iron is more /dense/ and more /heavy/ than water.
Thus one liter of iron contains /more matter/ than one liter of water does.
** Mass: How do we measure it?
The /mass/ of a thing is the amount of matter in that thing.

Tacit assumption: Things are made of a finite amount of matter.
- Water is made of water matter.
- Iron is made of iron matter.
- X is made of X matter, etc.

An object's mass can be measured indirectly by applying a controlled force to it and measuring its acceleration.
** Density: How do we measure it?
The average density is inferred by dividing the inferred mass and the measured volume.

- Define: /Density/ is mass per volume.
- Observe: Mass is not weight.
  - Jump around while measuring the weight of something.
  - The weight scale glitches.
- Assume: The mass of \( n \) copies of X is \( n \) times the mass of X.
  - Problems
    - What do we mean by a /copy/ of X? An /instance/ of X?
    - Tacit assumption: Copies of a thing are made of the same kind of matter.
    - Tacit assumption: Things of the same type behave in the same way.
  - Observe: The weight of \( n \) copies of X is \( n \) times the weight of X.
  - Assume: Weight is proportional to mass.
- History of measurement?[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_measurement]
** Volume: How do we measure it?
/Volume/ is amount of space occupied.
- Tacit assumption: Space exists.
- Tacit assumption: Space can be occupied.

/Volume/ is what volume meter measures.
Here is one way of measuring volume:
- Submerge the thing completely into a bucket full of water.
- The /volume/ of that thing is the amount of water that spills.

But what if the thing is not solid, or absorbs water, or reacts with water?
* Motion of medium objects
** Spaces, in which motion happens
*** Dimensions: How do we know?
How do we know how many dimensions a space has?

By the maximum number of lines that can be placed simultaneously while keeping them orthogonal to each other.

In general, we know that a space has dimension \(n\) if we cannot simultaneously place more than \(n\) mutually orthogonal lines in that space.

We know that our space has three dimensions because we see that if we have four lines orthogonal to each other,
then two of them must be parallel (and thus those four lines are not mutually orthogonal).
So far we have not found how to arrange more than three mutually orthogonal lines in our space.
*** Orthogonality: How do we know?
How do we know that two lines are orthogonal?

By a protractor?

We know that two lines are orthogonal if all the four angles formed by their intersection are equal.
A pair of orthogonal lines divides a full-turn into four equal angles.
*** Occupancy: How do we know?
In our everyday experience,
two different things cannot occupy the same space at the same time.
Is that also true in the microscopic level?
What does "two different things" mean?
What does "occupy" mean?
What does "the same space" mean?
What does "at the same time" mean?
** Movement and motion: Some obvious things
Both movement and motion[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_%28physics%29] mean a change of position,
but there is a subtle difference.
When we say "movement", we care only about whether an object has changed its position.
When we say "motion", we care about the trajectory, the details, how the object changed its position over time.

What is change?
Change is inequality, non-identity, non-sameness.
Change happens over /time/.

How do we know that an object moved?
By observing a change in its position.
A thing /moves/ iff its position changes.
Its /position/ is where it is in space.

/Displacement/ is relative position.
** Motion: Its measurement by sampling
We can measure the motion of an object by sampling its position at various times.

We may describe a man's motion as "At 4am he was on his bed. At 9am he was at his office. At 7pm he was at his home."

We may describe a star's motion as "In May it was 50 degrees upward from my house entrance. In June it was 40 degrees upward from my house entrance."

We can observe the motion of a tennis ball as follows.
We get a stopwatch, a pen, and a sheet of paper.
Then we make an observation sample by simultaneously recording where the tennis ball is and what time the stopwatch is showing.
Then we repeat that sampling.
Then we have an observation.
** Movement, described with vectors
The vector AB is the shortest path from point A (its origin) to point B (its destination).
Thus a vector has magnitude and direction.

A vector is usually drawn as a straight line with an arrowhead on its destination end.

In everyday situation, the shortest path connecting two points is a straight line.
However, in a long-haul flight, the shortest path is an arc, unless we drill through the Earth.

A coordinate is a tuple (a bunch, a group) of numbers.

The question "Where is something?" can be answered systematically, such as with postal addresses.

"Where is that point P?"
The Cartesian coordinate system answers "P is at \((1,2)\)"
to mean "from the point A, go 1 step east, then go 2 steps north, and then you will be at P".
** Position, described with coordinates
What is position?
Position is the relative place of things.
Is position a property of a thing?
Position is relative.
The position of a thing is measured with respect to another thing.

How do we describe the position of a thing?
By a coordinate system.
We pick a point called the /origin/, and pick three directions.
Then, each point in space can be described as a tuple \((x,y,z)\) of three numbers;
that tuple means "From the origin, go \(x\) steps east, \(y\) steps north, and \(z\) steps up."

A tuple is a bunch of numbers.

A coordinate system gives meaning to such tuples.

Cartesian coordinate systems?

A coordinate system is a method of naming every point.

Let \(E^n\) mean the \(n\)-dimensional Euclidean space.

A Cartesian coordinate system is a geometric interpretation of a real tuple space.
Such system uses
a tuple in \(\Real^n\) and three orthogonal axes
to describe a point in \(E^n\).
"Axes" here is plural of "axis", not of "axe".

For an example of a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, see the Wikipedia picture
 \footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg}}.
The positive x-axis points right.
The positive y-axis points up.

In three dimensions:
(A picture would be nice.)

The standard three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is right-handed.
With your right hand, form an L with the thumb and the index finger,
and form another L with the index and the middle finger.
Then see this table.

#+CAPTION: Standard directions
| direction | right hand finger | XYZ        |
|-----------+-------------------+------------|
| rightward | right thumb       | X positive |
| forward   | right index       | Y positive |
| leftward  |                   | X negative |
| backward  |                   | Y negative |
| upward    | right middle      | Z positive |
| downward  |                   | Z negative |

** TODO Speed: How do we measure it?
The /speed/ of an object is how fast it moves:
how far it moves in how much time.
/Fast/ means high speed,
going far in little time,
traveling much distance in little time.

/Average speed/ is distance traveled divided by time required.
** TODO Velocity: How do we measure it?
/Velocity/ is the rate of change of position.
Speed is the magnitude of velocity.
/Rate of change/ is defined by /derivative/.

We measure velocity of an object indirectly, by comparing the object's position at various times.
** Motion, described with functions
A /real function/ can summarize the sampling of the motion of an object.
The function extrapolates the table of observations.
It is straightforward to see and test the correspondence
between the mathematical description and the described reality:
We just check whether the function approximates the values in the table of observation.
The function is much more compact but has slightly more errors than the table.
A good model sacrifices a little correctness to gain a lot of simplicity.

But then there was relativity.
Now we have to model the other observer's time.

But then there was quantum mechanics.
Now we cannot model position as a real function.

We can make a table of observations relating
the time of observation and
the position of an object at that time.

Force is what we feel when a spring resists our pull.
With mathematics, we can give meaning to phrases like "twice the force".

Real functions are not the only way to model motions.
** Motion, described with ordered sets
We can model motion as a set of positions and an order.
We can write A < B < C to mean that the particle was at A before it was at B,
and it was at B before it was at C.
*** Describing motion
A description of a thing's motion answers the question "Where is that thing when?"
Such description relates position and time.
**** Function relating time and displacement
We can think of a thing's displacement at time \(t\) as a mathematical /function/ \(x\) such that \(x(t)\) is the thing's displacement at time \(t\).
Note that the function is \(x\), not \(x(t)\).

An example of an equation of motion is $x(t) = 2 \hat{e} t$ where \(\hat{e}\) is a unit vector.
It describes an object that moves with constant velocity \(2 \hat{e}\) (constant speed 2 towards constant direction \(\hat{e}\)).
**** Equation of motion
An /equation of motion/ is an equation that describes
the motion of an object by relating time and displacement.

Each equation of motion corresponds to a moving thing.
If we want to describe \(n\) moving things, we make \(n\) equations of motion.

An example of /implicit/ equation is $x(t) = - (d(d(x)))(t)$.
This is also an example of a /differential equation/ because it contains the derivative operator $d$.
**** Basis???
Let $e$ be a linear basis.
Suppose that the displacement of an object at time $t$ is
$x(t) = e(x_1(t), \ldots, x_n(t))$.
Then the velocity at time $t$ is $v(t) = \der(x,t) = e(v_1(t), \ldots, v_n(t))$.
Can we say that $v_k(t) = \der(x_k,t)$?

Moral of the story:
If we have a linear basis,
then doing calculus on the coordinates
is doing calculus on the vectors.
*** Kinematics, description of motion
A /frame/ defines /where/ and /when/.
*** Spaces
We can think of a /physical space/ (where we exist) as a /mathematical space/ (a set of points).
In this document we often conflate those two spaces without warning.
**** Thinking of our local physical space as Euclidean space
We can think of the space near us as a /three-dimensional Euclidean space/,
which is our intuition of space as we experience it in our everyday lives.
**** Real tuple spaces
An \(n\)-tuple is a bunch of \(n\) possibly different things.

A real \(n\)-tuple is a bunch of \(n\) real numbers.

The set \(\Real^n\) (the /\(n\)-dimensional real tuple space/) is the set of all real \(n\)-tuples.
For example, we say that the real 3-tuple \((1,2,3)\) is "a /member/ of" or "an /element/ of" or "a /point/ in" \(\Real^3\).

The /dimension/ of \(\Real^n\) is \(n\).

A real tuple space is a mathematical space, not a physical space.
**** Universal tacit assumptions
(Do we have to talk about this?)

We assume the isotropy of space, that every part of space is the same everywhere.

We assume Uniformitarianism (which one?),
that the laws of physics is the same everywhere in the Universe.[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformitarianism]
We assume the /principle of the uniformity of nature/,
that the laws of nature is the same everywhere everytime \cite{hume1793inquiry}.
*** Newton's model of motion
We can use Newton's equations of motion.
There are many big simplifications:
A rigid body is simplified to a point mass occupying no space.
Space and time is absolute.
Force acts instantaneously.
** TODO Frames: Relative motions?
Understanding moving frames?

A frame of reference may be \emph{moving},
for example when you look outside from a moving car.

Understanding inertial frames?

An \emph{inertial frame of reference} \(R\) is a frame of reference such that
for each each object \( M \), if the net force acting on \( M \) is zero, then \(R\) sees that the acceleration of \(M\) is zero.

Simple motion?
Motion with constant velocity.

If A sees B moving toward A, then B sees A moving toward B.
** TODO Gravity? How do we know?
Newton's key insight is that everything falls in the /same manner/ (due to the /same cause/ that is named "gravity"):
Both an apple on a tree and the moon in the sky are falling towards the Earth in the same manner.

Newton's cannonball[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_cannonball].

Einstein's key insight is that acceleration and gravity are exactly the same thing?
** TODO Falling?
To fall is to passively move toward the Earth.

Falling is the natural unassisted uncontrolled unmodified unaltered motion of things toward the Earth.

We can see that an object falling from height \(h\) requires a time \(t\) to reach the ground, where \( t = \sqrt{2 g h} \) and \(g \approx 10 \meter\per\second^2\).
** TODO Classical mechanics: How do we test it?
Confirming experiments:

The experiment of dropping a feather and a ball in vacuum confirms classical mechanics.

Disagreeing experiments:

Problem in atomic theory?

Double-slit electron experiment?
** TODO Curvature: How do we know?
How do we know that spacetime is bent,
if all we see is a bent trajectory of light?

If we assume that light travels in a straight line,
then we have to infer that it is the propagation medium that is bent.

How do we know we are on a sphere?
Keep moving in the same direction, and end up at where you began.

How do we know that our space is curved?

** TODO Spacetime curvature due to matter: How do we know?
Matter bends spacetime, especially the spacetime /near that matter/.
What does it mean?

Spacetime curvature accelerates matter.

Einstein could predict some things from philosophy/reasoning/logic/language/German/English without mathematics/analysis/calculus/differential-geometry/calculations/numbers?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_general_relativity

He used philosophy to derive the mathematics, not the other way around?
** TODO Curve, described with functions?
A smooth curve in a two-dimensional space can be described by a function \( \Real \to \Real^2 \).

A smooth surface in a three-dimensional space can be described by a function \( \Real^2 \to \Real^3 \).
* Force and motion
** Force and motion: Which causes which?
Reverse dynamics: Motion causes force?

A force causes a change in an object's motion.

A change in object's motion causes the object to feel force?

Given the force acting on an object, we can compute the object's motion.

Given the object's motion, we can compute the force acting on the object.

Centrifugal force is an example of force that is caused by a change in the object's motion?
If we are driving a car and we turn the steering wheel to the left,
we feel a force pushing us to the right.
** Can we directly observe force?
We can feel if we are falling or if we are standing tilted.

Even when we are measuring a force with a dynamometer,
we are really observing the position of the dynamometer needle,
not the force itself.
We never see forces in the way we see colors.
We only assume the existence of forces,
and we assume that force is the direct cause of motion.

A thing changes its motion because there are forces acting on it.

By saying "force is the cause of motion",
we have not really explained much;
we have merely named the cause.

We can also bypass philosophy, and simply define /force/ to be what a force meter measures.
A force meter[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_meter] may be a spring.
Weighing scale[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighing_scale].
Dynamometer[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamometer].

Hooke's law[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law]:

Let X be a thing.

Hang a copy of X on a spring.
The spring lengthens by \( x \) from its resting length.

Hang two copies of X on a spring.
The spring lengthens by \( 2 \cdot x \) from its resting length.
** Weight: How do we measure it?
Pretend that the concept of \emph{mass} has not been invented.

It is evident that things weigh.
One can verify it by trying to lift them.

\emph{Weight} is what a weight balance measures.

A weight balance has two arms.

Put a weight on an end of a weight balance.
Push the other end with your hand until the balance comes to rest.
When they reach equilibrium,
both of them exerts the same amount of \emph{force}.
** Superposition of forces: How do we test it?
Forces acting on an object obey the \emph{superposition principle}:
the result of two forces \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) acting on the same object
is the same as the result of one force \(F_1+F_2\) acting on that object.

The \emph{net force} acting on an object is the sum of all other forces acting on that object.

\emph{Resultant force} is another term for \emph{net force}.

But how do we know?

What is the limit of superposition of forces?

If a thing is pulled to the left and equally-strongly pulled to the right at the same time,
then it will eventually break, given big enough forces.

Does this hold for "point particles"?
** How do we know that a frame of reference has zero acceleration?
If we accelerate toward a man who is standing still,
then it is the same as if he were accelerating toward us with the same magnitude of acceleration,
but in the reverse direction,
but he does not report feeling any forces,
even though, from our point of view, he is accelerating toward us.

** Dynamics, force, cause of motion
*** Force, momentum
In philosophy, force is a synonym of cause;
thus to force X to do Y is to cause X to do Y.

/Force/ is the rate of change of momentum (Newton 1687, 1728).

Informally and vaguely, /momentum/ is the amount of motion in an object, that is, how hard it is to stop.

Effect of frame of reference on momentum conservation?[fn::https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/363298/during-a-collision-why-is-momentum-not-conserved-in-a-participants-frame-of-re/363299]
*** How do we know that weight is gravitational force?
** Newton's second law of motion
If an object has constant mass \( m \) and a constant force \( F \) is acting on it,
then \( a = F/m \) is that object's constant acceleration.

Newton said momentum, not acceleration?
** Understanding mass
\footnote{\url{http://www.ag-physics.org/rmass/}}
\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass}}
The \emph{mass} of an object is the difficulty of changing its velocity.

Mass is resistance to force.

The mass of an object is the amount of matter in that object.

The \emph{rest mass} of an object is its mass measured if it is at rest.
** Understanding force
\emph{Force} is the rate of change of momentum.

A force \emph{acts} on an object.
** Using vectors to model forces and others
Position, momentum, velocity, acceleration, and force are modeled by \emph{vectors} (\S\ref{sec:vector}).
The position of \(B\) as measured from \(A\) is modeled by a \emph{vector} \(AB\).
** Path of an object in a field
\emph{Path} of an object moving in a field.
A \emph{conservative force} is a force whose work depends only on the difference between the beginning and ending position,
and not in the path?
A force whose work is the same for every path from \(A\) to \(B\)?
The \emph{action} of a path?
Principle of stationary action?
** Conservative force
\footnote{\url{https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_force}}

Conservative force \emph{conserves} mechanical energy.
** Generalization
Weight is gravitational force.
** Weight
After Newton's law of universal gravitation,
\emph{weight} means gravitational force.
The weight of an object on Earth is the gravitational force exerted by Earth on that object.
\emph{Work} generalizes to \( W = F \cdot x \).

\emph{Work} was defined as weight times height.

** Law of the lever: How do we test it?
Law of the lever: \( F_1 \cdot r_1 = F_2 \cdot r_2 \).

Move the fulcrum, or slide the lever along the fulcrum.

A \emph{lever} has a fulcrum and two ends.

Let \(r_1\) be the distance between the first end to the fulcrum.

Let \(r_2\) be the distance between the second end to the fulcrum.

Let \(F_1\) be the weight placed at the first end.

\emph{Law of the lever}:
Such lever at equilibrium satisfies \(F_1 \cdot r_1 = F_2 \cdot r_2\).

We take this law as evident.
Doubt can be removed by a simple experiment.

Thus, a weight balance is a lever whose arms have equal length.
** ? Polynomials; Galileo's ramps
Galileo did some quadratic polynomial interpolation (curve fitting)?

Galileo put a ramp (inclined plane)[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclined_plane],
rolled a ball from the plane's top,
and measured the time required by the ball to reach the plane's bottom.
Put a ball at the high end of an inclined plane,
and measure the duration required by the ball to reach the low end of the inclined plane.

He found that the duration is proportional to the square root of the length of the plane if the inclination angle is held constant.
Probably through a table of logarithms, in the same way Kepler calculated the exponents in his laws of planetary motion.

A narrow ramp.
To measure time, he put bells along the ramp.
The rolling ball hits different bells at different times.

* TODO (Replace emphasis from math to epistemology)
** An example basis?
Imagine a flat sheet of paper.

Draw a point \(A\).

Draw a vector named \(i\), from \(A\), \SI{1}{cm} long, pointing right.

Draw another vector named \(j\), also from \(A\), 1 cm long, but pointing up.

Thus, the vectors \(i\) and \(j\) are /orthogonal/.

Then, we declare the basis
\( e : \Real^2 \to E^2 \) as \( e(x,y) = xi + yj \).

A real tuple space on its own has no geometric meaning.
One way to visualize a real tuple space is a Cartesian coordinate system.
** Field?
Does a gravitational field have material existence?
Is gravitational field physical or mathematical?
A gravitational field /describes/ the gravitational force that a unit point mass /would/ experience.
Note the counterfactual.
The verb /describes/ implies that the subject (a gravitational field) is abstract.

At first I think matter changes spacetime around it, and we call this change "field".
But Quantum Field Theory seems to imply that the fields are real, and matter seems to be our limited perception of the fields.

We think that a matter establishes an associated gravitational field.

Einstein's E = mc2 is about that gravity affects both energy and mass.

A Lagrangian tells how a system interchanges potential energy and kinetic energy?

We can use continuum mechanics.

QFT is basically a mathematical model of motion, like Newton's theory, but with fewer simplifying assumptions.
Theoretical physics advances by removing simplifying assumptions.

Lagrangian and Hamiltonian are mathematical things.
Do they have physical meaning?
** Coordinate transformations
A coordinate transformation is a mapping between from one coordinate system to another.
*** Some coordinate systems
A \emph{coordinate system} maps a coordinate tuple to a vector.
**** The rectangular coordinate system
\(R(x,y) = x e_1 + y e_2\).

\(R(x) = x_1 e_1 + x_2 e_2\).

In this system, the coordinates are the scalar coefficients in the linear combination of basis vectors.
The coordinates describe how the basis vectors should be linearly combined to form the described vector.

Let \(T : V^2 \to V^2\) be a linear transformation.
Then \(T(R(x)) = T(x_1 e_1 + x_2 e_2) = x_1 \cdot T(e_1) + x_2 \cdot T(e_2) = x_1 e_1' + x_2 e_2' = R'(x) \).
**** The polar coordinate system
\(P(r,t) = r e_1 \text{ rotated } t \text{ radians counterclockwise}\).

\section{Locating the same point with different coordinate systems}

Example of coordinate transformation:
The same point in the same two-dimensional Euclidean space
is described by
both the polar coordinates \( (r,\theta) \)
and the rectangular coordinates \( (r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta) \).
The transformation is \( (r,\theta) \to (r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta) \).

What
 \footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_coordinate_space}}
 \footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_coordinate_space}}
 \footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis}}

A \emph{coordinate system} $M : C \to S$ is a surjective mapping from
\emph{coordinate space} $C$ to \emph{target space} $S$.

A \emph{coordinate} is a point in \(C\).
The coordinate system tells us how to get to a point.

The \(n\)-dimensional real coordinate space is $\mathbb{R}^n$.
It is also called the real $n$-space.
A point in the real $n$-space is an $n$-tuple of real numbers $(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$.

$(x,y)$ is the tuple of coordinates,
$x$ is the x-coordinate, and $y$ is the y-coordinate.

Coordinate systems unify geometry and
mathematical analysis.
With coordinates,
we can solve geometric problems by
numbers, calculus, and algebra,
so that computers can
find the intersection of geometric objects
by solving the corresponding system of equations,
and find the size of a geometric object by solving the corresponding integral.
*** Converting polar coordinate tuples to rectangular coordinate tuples
Both the rectangular coordinate $(r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta)$ and the polar coordinate $(r,\theta)$
describe the same point in two-dimensional Euclidean space.
\[
R(r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta) = P(r,\theta)
\]

A point in a space can have different coordinates in different coordinate systems.
** Gases?
The gas flows according to the pressure difference.

Imagine a room full of gas.
We are interested in modeling the flow of such gas.

We assume that a part of gas can always be split into smaller parts.

Let \( P(x) \) be the pressure at point \(x\).

Defining "pressure at a point" requires rejecting the theory of atoms.
It is surprising that a model that violates the theory of atoms
is so accurate at describing the motions of things that consist of atoms.
Why does this assumption not invalidate the model?
** What
https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-misunderstood-thing-in-physics

See "You can never actually fall into a black hole."
** Spherical coordinate systems
(Why do we bring this up?)
*** Mathematician's heading
To simplify the explanation of the coming spherical coordinate system,
we introduce "heading".

Our definition of heading begins with \ang{0} pointing east (positive x-axis),
and then goes counterclockwise,
so \ang{90} is north (positive y-axis), \ang{180} is west (negative x-axis),
and \ang{270} is south (negative y-axis).

Note that our heading differs from the navigator's heading,
which begins with \ang{0} pointing north and then goes clockwise.
 \footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_direction\#Additional_points}}
*** The spherical coordinate system
The spherical coordinates \((r,a,b)\) mean
"set heading to \(a\), set elevation to \(b\), and then go the distance \(r\)".

The spherical coordinate system adds another angle component to the polar coordinate system.

We now describe how to map the spherical coordinates \(S(r,a,b)\) to Cartesian coordinates \(C(x,y,z)\).
The slogan to remember is that \(S(r,a,b)\) means
\enquote{set heading to \(a\),
set elevation to \(b\),
and then go the distance \(r\)}.
Another slogan is \enquote{face east, turn your head left by angle \(a\),
turn your head up by angle \(b\), and then look at distance \(r\)}.

Let's read slower as we imagine the drawing.

Let \(O\) be the center of both the spherical coordinate system and the Cartesian coordinate system.
Let their centers coincide.

A negative angle \(-a\) means the angle \(a\) but in the reverse direction.

Draw the point \(D\) at \(C(r,0,0)\),
which means that \(D\) lies on the positive x-axis,
at distance \(r\) from \(O\).

With the positive z-axis as the axis of rotation,
rotate the vector \(OD\), by angle \(a\) toward the positive y-axis
(or toward the negative y-axis if \(a\) is negative).
Call the resulting vector \(OE\).
Thus, the point \(E\) is at \(C(r \cos a, r \sin a, 0)\),
which is still on the xy-plane.

Then, rotate the vector \(OE\), by angle \(b\),
out of the xy-plane, toward the positive z-axis
(or toward the negative z-axis if \(b\) is negative).
Call the resulting vector \(OF\).

Then \(F\) is the point described by \(S(r,a,b)\).
*** Relationship with Cartesian coordinate systems
Let's say that the point \(F\) is at \(S(r,a,b)\), which is equal to \(C(x,y,z)\).
By the definition of rotation and the congruence of triangles,
we can convert spherical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates as follows:
\begin{align}
    x &= r \cos a \cos b
    \\
    y &= r \sin a \cos b
    \\
    z &= r \sin b
\end{align}

We can convert Cartesian coordinates to spherical coordinates as follows:
\begin{align}
    r &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
    \\
    \tan a &= y/x
    \\
    \sin b &= z/r
\end{align}
but we have to pick the angles that make the signs correct.

Thus, we have just explained what is meant by the slogan
\enquote{set heading to \(a\),
set elevation to \(b\),
and then go the distance \(r\)}.
*** Which spherical coordinate system?
Note that our \(b\) is elevation, not azimuth.
The relationship between elevation and azimuth is
\[
    \text{azimuth} = \ang{90} - \text{elevation}.
\]

If the elevation is zero, then the spherical coordinate system reduces
to the polar coordinate system on the xy-plane.
That method embeds the polar coordinate system into the xy-plane.
Thus the angle \(a\) is called heading angle, polar angle, or longitude.
The angle \(b\) is called elevation angle or latitude.

Azimuth is angle from zenith.
In this case, zenith is the z-axis.

Azimuth?
Elevation?

** Relating velocities, tangent lines, and derivatives

There are several ways of understanding $f'(x)$ (the derivative of $f$ at $x$):

***** Average velocity and the secant line

Let there be an object.

Let $x(t) : V^2$ be a vector that describes its position at time $t : \Real$.

The /average velocity/ of that object in the time interval $[t,t+\Delta t]$ is
$$\frac{x(t+\Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t}.$$

If at time $t_1$ its position is $x_1$
and at time $t_2$ its position is $x_2$,
then its /average velocity/ in the time interval between $t_1$ and $t_2$
is $(x_2 - x_1) / (t_2 - t_1)$.

A /secant line of $f$/ is a line that passes $(x_1,f(x_1))$ and $(x_2,f(x_2))$.
Think of average velocity.

***** Instantaneous velocity and the tangent line

If the position of an object at time $t$ is $x(t)$,
then its /instantaneous velocity/ at time $t$ is $v(t) = (d(x))(t)$.
The velocity function is the derivative of the position function.

The term /instantaneous velocity/ is often shortened to just /velocity/.

The unqualified /velocity/ means /instantaneous velocity/.

A car's speedometer measures its instantaneous speed.

Derivative is about /rate of change/:
how fast a function changes value,
how big is the change in output compared to the change in input.

Consider a function $f : \Real \to \Real$.
If the input is $x$, then the output is $f(x)$.
If you change the input by $\dd{x}$, the output changes by $\dd{y}$.
Formally, $f(x+\dd{x}) = f(x)+\dd{y}$.

A /tangent line of $f$ at $x$/ is what the secant line converges to
if both $x_1$ and $x_2$ converge to $x$.
Think of instantaneous velocity.

***** Understanding the derivative as the slope of the tangent line

The /derivative of $f$ at $x$/ is the slope of the tangent line of $f$ at $x$.
Reminder: The line $y = mx + c$ has slope $m$.

** Coordinates
** Coordinate systems
A coordinate system is a way of /naming/ points in a space.

A coordinate system over E describes how to /name/ each point in E, how to locate those points.
The name of a point is a tuple of numbers.

How does Newton's equation work with generalized coordinates?

Example of generalized coordinates x(q) = (q,q2,0).
Bead on a rail on xy-plane.
** Newtonian?
We can think of a rigid body as a point mass, as Newton did.
Center of mass of a rigid body.
No collision.
A field makes more sense than point mass.

But, with calculus, we can have mass density.
Calculus enables continuum mechanics.
** Mechanics?
2017-12-18 05:29:06.343592295 +0700

\emph{Mechanics} is a theory of motion.

Reading:
\emph{The science of mechanics} by Ernst Mach.
Historical evolution.
The principles of statics.
The principles of dynamics.
** Mechanical system
A \emph{mechanical system} is a set of objects \( \{ M_1,\ldots,M_n \} \) and forces \( \{ F_1,\ldots,F_n \} \).
Each \(F_k\) is an expression.
With Newton's laws, we can turn such mechanical system into \(n\) equations,
each of the form \( F_k = m_k \cdot d(d(x_k)) \) for \(k\) from 1 to \(n\).

One way of describing the motion of an object is by modeling time as a real number \( t \),
and modeling the position as a function of time \( x : \Real \to \Real^n \).
Thus, at time \( t \), the object is at \( x(t) \).
** Potential energy
\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy}}

Wikipedia "potential energy":
Potential energy is associated with forces that act on a body in a way that the total work done by these forces on the body depends only on the initial and final positions of the body in space. These forces, that are called conservative forces, can be represented at every point in space by vectors expressed as gradients of a certain scalar function called potential.
** Field as gradient of potential

** More complex cases?
So far everything has been constant.
Now we shall consider the case where they change with time.

Let \(g\) be a vector.
For understanding phase space, we will consider
the motion of a point mass \(M\) influenced by a uniform gravitational field \( G(x) = g \).

The acceleration will be \( a(t) = g \).
The velocity can be obtained by integrating \( a \).
The position and acceleration are related by the equation \( a = d(d(x)) \).
In Newtonian dynamics, if we know \( x(0) \), \( v(0) \),
and all the forces acting on a body,
then we can calculate the trajectory (all past and future position and velocity) of that body.

Let \( F(t) \) be the \emph{force acting on \( M \)} (that is, the sum of all forces acting on \(M\)) at time \(t\).
Let \( x(t) \) be the position of \( M \) at time \(t\).
Let \( v(t) \) be the velocity of \( M \) at time \(t\).
Let \( a(t) \) be the acceleration of \( M \) at time \(t\).
Then \( a = d(v) \) and \( v = d(x) \).
Let \( p : \Real \to \Real^n \).
Let \( p(t) \) be the momentum of \( M \) at time \( t \).
Then \( F = d(p) \).

Newton's laws of motion:
\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton\%27s_laws_of_motion}}

First law:
In an inertial frame of reference, an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a force.
Second law:
In an inertial reference frame, the vector sum of the forces F on an object is equal to the mass m of that object multiplied by the acceleration a of the object: \( F = d \ p \).
Let \( p : T \to M \cdot V \).
Third law:
When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.

** ? Analytic geometry, and kinematics
Kinematics is about /describing/ motion, not /explaining/ (finding the cause of) motion.

Analytic geometry is the usage of coordinate systems for thinking about spaces?

Analytic geometry can be thought of doing geometry by manipulating numbers instead of by drawing shapes.

With analytic geometry, we can describe shapes using real numbers.

"The power of analytic geometry derives very largely from the fact
that it permits the methods of the calculus, and, more generally, of
mathematical analysis, to be introduced into geometry."

* TODO Light, and its geometry?
** How do we know that light travels in a straight line?
From the shape of shadows and reflections.

We know that light travels in a straight line, from comparing the shape of an object and its shadow.

The image in a mirror has the same shape as the original thing, but the left and right are swapped.
This is consistent with the hypothesis that light travels at a straight line.

Mirrors reflect light in a similar way that walls reflect rolling balls.
The ball is reflected because momentum is conserved?

Let A be a point passed by a light ray some time before it hits the front of a mirror.

Let B be a point where the ray hits the front of the mirror.

Let C be a point where the ray is found some time after it has hit the front of the mirror.

Let D be a point in front of the mirror such that BD is perpendicular to the mirror.

Then the angle ABD (the angle of incidence) is equal to the angle DBC (the angle of reflection).
 [fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_incidence_(optics)]
 [fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)]

An observer would not be able to tell any difference between
whether a ray of light came from somewhere else and is reflected by the mirror,
and whether the ray of light originated from the mirror and is emitted by the mirror itself.
We may as well reason that the incident ray of light is first absorbed by the mirror
and then the mirror emits another ray of light in a certain direction.
** How do we know that a line is straight?
We know that a line is straight, if we cannot shorten the line any further without moving the endpoints.

We can also define "straight" as the way light moves in a free space.
We can define that a line is straight if it is possible for light to have a trajectory of such shape in free space.

A /line/ is a one-dimensional thing.

A line /connects/ point P to point Q iff one end of the line is P and the other end of the line is Q.

For short lines, we can see with our eyes whether it is practically straight.

The /distance/ between two points is the length of the shortest line connecting them.

A line connecting two points is /straight/ iff that line is the shortest line connecting those points.
When we travel on Earth without ever turning,
we think we are traveling in a straight line,
but after about 40,000 km we will arrive at where we departed from.
Someone far enough in the sky will see that we are traveling in a great circle.
If you find it hard to imagine the size of the Earth,
just imagine that you were an ant-sized human on a tennis ball.

A /geodesic/ is a straight line?
** How do we measure how much light is there?
Darkness is the absence of light.

Daytime is lit.
Nighttime is dark.
But a cave is always dark, regardless of what time it is outside.

Objects have different brightnesses.

Light can be blocked by matter.
** If light is a wave, how do we measure its speed and wavelength?
In 1675, Ole Rømer calculated the speed of light, based on the moons of Jupiter,
but its verification requires the alignment of some celestial bodies, which cannot be procured at will.
 [fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B8mer%27s_determination_of_the_speed_of_light]
 [fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light#History]

The wavelength can be measured indirectly with a formula that involves the size of the pattern in a diffraction grating.

** The cavity studied by Planck?
Cavity: opaque box with a small hole.
Rays of light enter the box through the hole at various angles.
Because the box is enclosed, there is very little chance that a ray of light can enter the box and leave it without hitting any walls.
A ray of light entering the box through the hole hits a wall, is reflected, hits another wall, and so on, many times, and is eventually absorbed.
If it is probable that a ray is absorbed every time it hits a wall, then it is even more probable that such ray is absorbed when it hits walls many times.
Thus the hole appears black from outside.

German "der Hohlraum" is cognate of English "the hole-room"?
** Light-matter interaction
Reflect, absorb, diffract.

How do we know whether a thing absorbs light?

Shine some light onto it.

How do we know when an electron absorbs light?

How do we know that light is polarized?

How do we measure the polarization of light?
How do we polarize light?

Light-electron interaction?

Light is electromagnetic wave with electric-field component and magnetic-field component.

The electric-field component of light influences a free electron.
 [fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_scattering]
** Is light matter?
If light were matter,
then shining some light on an object would move the object.

But a ball hitting a wall does not seem to move the wall.
Does it mean that the ball is not matter?
Or does the wall indeed move, only by a very little distance?

Shining some light on an object does move the object.

* TODO Oscillations, waves, and differential equations
** Oscillations
An oscillation can be modeled by a periodic function such as
\( f(t) = f(t+p) \) where \( p \) is the period.

An ideal oscillation exactly repeats after one period.

Here are some examples of simple oscillation.
A spring will oscillate if it is suddenly released after being pulled a little from its resting position.
A pendulum will oscillate if it is suddenly released after being pulled from its resting position.

What does "moving energy" mean?
Earlier we said that energy is a mathematical concept and not a physical reality.

The oscillation of a spring can be modeled by a differential equation.
We assume that the restoring force is \( F(x) = - k x \).
Then, force is the rate of change of momentum, then substitute...
(TODO)
** Waves
Imagine that we are holding an end of a taut rope whose other end is tied to a pole.
We write \( h(x,t) \) to mean the amplitude (the vertical displacement) of the point at the rope at horizontal distance \(x\) from our hand at time \(t\).
Thus \( h(0,t) \) is the vertical displacement of our hands at time \(t\).
We assume that the wave propagates at constant velocity \(v\).
Thus, after a duration \(dt\) has elapsed, the wavefront at \(x\) at time \(t\) has moved to \(x + v \cdot dt\):
We write this \( h(x + v \cdot dt, t + dt) = h(x, t) \),
which can be rearranged to \( h(x, t) = h(0, t - x / v) \).
If we want to easily know how the rest of the rope behaves given our hand motion,
we can rearrange the equation to \( h(x, t + x / v) = h(0, t) \).
The amplitudes are simply the "echoes" of our hand motion.
Each point moves imitating our hand motion, but that point's motion is delayed proportionally to its distance from our hand.

When we throw a stone into a pool of water, the disturbance travels as an expanding circle.
This implies that the disturbance propagates equally in all directions.
We say that water is an isotropic medium.
** What is a wave, oscillation, undulation, vibration?
One /wave/ happens every time water slaps the beach.
Thus waves are countable.

We see ripples when we throw a stone into a body of water.
Ripples are waves?

We see oscillation when we disturb a spring (the spiral thing, not the water source).

A wave is a pattern of motion.
A wave does not exist objectively.
We see waves.
We use the word "wave" to refer to some repetitive motions.

"Wave moves energy without moving matter"[fn::"What Are Gravitational Waves?" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmiPDvz0WVU]
But matter is congealed energy[fn::https://www.ted.com/talks/david_christian_big_history/transcript?language=en]?
But energy is only a mathematical artifact, an unreal quantity.
** What causes a wave?
A wave is caused by a /restoring force/[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restoring_force],
a force that goes against a thing's displacement.
This force tends to restore a thing to its resting position.

Wave happens because the propagation medium has /inertia/ that laggedly opposes the forces acting on it.

A wave is a propagating oscillation, a contagious oscillation?

Must a wave always be caused by a restoring force?
Must a restoring force exist wherever we see a wave?

What do we mean by "force"?
Do we mean Newtonian "force", or do we mean "cause"?

https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/25003/what-is-the-philosophical-origin-of-waves

http://www.informationphilosopher.com/introduction/physics/wave-particle_duality.html
** What is the difference between these: wave, undulation, oscillation, resonance?
** Sine waves
A sine wave is the motion of an ideal spring that is oscillating naturally after released from an initial strain.

A sine wave is approximated by a pendulum with long rope and small swing angle.

A sine function is a function such that its displacement and its acceleration have equal magnitudes but opposite directions.

A sine function \(x\) is a solution of \( d(d(x)) = -x \).
** Dropping a pebble into a pond
Imagine looking down on a pond from bird's-eye view,
and gently dropping a pebble into the pond.

The pebble displaces a volume of water around it.
The displaced volume of water displaces other nearby volumes of water,
and so on.
** Diffraction
Outsource to Wikipedia
 [fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction]
 [fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_formalism]?

It seems that justifing the Huygens--Fresnel principle[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens%E2%80%93Fresnel_principle]
requires fluid dynamics.

Single-slit diffraction

Calculate the pattern spacing depending on propagation medium characteristics, slit size, slit spacing, and the distance between slit and screen.

Kirchhoff's diffraction formula[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_diffraction_formula]?

Young's double-slit experiment
** Wavefront, reflection, and diffraction
A point disturbance such as a pebble dropped into the pond causes an expanding circle /wavefront/ on the surface.
This speed in which this circle expands is the /speed of the propagation/ of disturbances in water.

An obstacle reflects the sector of the wavefront that hits it.
* --- Part --- The bridge between medium and small
Electrochemistry, statistical physics (mechanics, thermodynamics)?

In this part, we try to justify the existence of small objects.
* Gaining knowledge of small things by indirect observations and inferences
** Mindsets
The physics of small objects is not intuitive.
Everything is inferred indirectly.
It requires a lot of abductive reasoning.

We can only manipulate medium-sized objects, due to the limitation of our senses.
Everything else, we can only infer, indirectly,
by transduction through experimental apparatuses into something of medium size.
** Reasoning with deduction, induction, and abduction
Deduction is the use of syllogism?

Induction is generalization from examples.
The difficulty is in finding examples diverse enough to represent most possibilities.
Example:
We saw that there are ten white swans.
Thus we infer that all swans are white.
(Then we find a black swan.)

Abduction is finding the best explanation for a surprising evidence.
Example:
We observe that the road is wet everywhere.
We abduce the hypothetical explanation that it may have rained a few hours ago.
Another example:
We cannot find the scissors at home; they are not at the usual location.
We abduce that it must be due to our siblings.

We cannot live without deduction, but we cannot live with only deduction either.

Reddit has a summary[fn::https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/uu5wp/a_priori_vs_a_posteriori_deductive_vs_inductive/] of deduction and induction.
** Sensor galore, sensor design mindset, transduction/apparatus mindset
Voltage is measured with volt-meter,
amperage is measured with ampere-meter,
ohmage is measured with ohm-meter,
pressure is measured with pressure-meter,
temperature is measured with temperature-meter,
X is measured with X-meter,
and so on.

How do we /know/ X => How do we /detect/ X => How do we /measure/ X => How do we /design an apparatus/ for measuring X?

How do we translate a microscopic phenomenon into something macroscopic that we can perceive directly with our senses.

For example: electroscope => electrometer.

For example:
- How do we detect electric current?
  By observing the corrosion of the metal electrodes of an electrochemical cell.
- How do we measure electric current?
  By measuring the /rate/ of the corrosion above.

How do we measure the magnitude of X?

How do we measure the direction of X?
** Calculus, scale invariance, and naïve abstract miniaturization
By using calculus, we assume that a thing can always be scaled down
into an ever-smaller version of it that behaves exactly the same, only smaller.

We often assume scale invariance[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_invariance].

How can an assumption so wrong produce a model so right?
** Reductionism and emergent behavior
Reductionism:
The macroscopic properties of matter /emerge/ from the microscopic properties.
Every macroscopic phenomenon can be explained in terms of what is happening microscopically.
* Electricity
** Electricity: What is it?
"[C]ertain objects, such as rods of amber,
could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers"[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electricity&oldid=904686616]

We say that such rubbed amber /exhibits electricity/.

Thus electricity is the interaction of electric charges.

However, these things might be easier to find in a 21st-century city:
- Glass (instead of amber).
- Silk or wool (instead of cat fur).
- Pieces of paper (instead of feather).

If two things attract each other after they are rubbed against each other, then they exhibit electricity?

Triboelectricity: charging by friction.

How do we measure how much charged an object is?
"The quantity of electric charge can be directly measured with an electrometer, or indirectly measured with a ballistic galvanometer."
 [fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electric_charge&oldid=904446147]
By measuring the deflection of the leaf of an electroscope[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrometer],
by exploiting electrostatic induction.
A problem is that touching the electrometer discharges the object.

We assume that charge is a property of matter.

To /charge/ a thing is to make it exhibit electricity.
** Electric charges
*** Two kinds of charges: How do we know?
Two kinds of charges,
/vitreous/ (Latinate English for "glassy")

*** How was the battery invented before the concept of currents was invented?
From
an article[fn::https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/Galvani_Volta]
and another article[fn::https://helix.northwestern.edu/article/experiment-shocked-world].

Galvani, Volta, animal limbs, and metals.

Volta found that using two different kinds of metals twitches the frog legs more than using only one kind of metal.

They would not have known; electrochemistry was not yet known.
Galvani experimented with frog legs in 1791, and died in 1798.
Galvanometers did not exist before 1820.
 [fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanometer#History]
 [fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Galvani]

Volta discovered bimetal[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimetal] electricity,
Volta invented the Voltaic pile for bioelectricity, not for electrochemistry.
Moreover, Volta's idea of current was the obsolete "contact tension" theory.

"1778 – Volta discovered that the /electrical potential/ (we now often call this the /voltage/)
in a capacitor is directly proportional to electrical charge."[fn::https://www.famousscientists.org/alessandro-volta/]

From Italian Wikipedia[fn::https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Volta]:
- Nel 1778 nella lettera a de Saussure /Sulla capacità dei conduttori elettrici/ ("On the capacity of electrical conductors") [...]
- Nel 1780 inventa il "condensatore di elettricità", apparecchio che serve a ricevere, accumulare, condensare in sé e rendere visibile anche le più deboli quantità di elettricità.

 [fn::http://ppp.unipv.it/Volta/Pages/eF5struD.html]
 [fn::http://museu.fis.uc.pt/121ing.htm]
is an apparatus for measuring electric charges too weak for
straw electrometers[fn::https://catalogue.museogalileo.it/object/StrawElectrometerVoltaType.html] to measure.

In the study of "animal electricity", many frogs were harmed.[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog_battery]
But finally "Alessandro Volta showed that the frog was not necessary.
[...]
Earlier Volta had established the law of capacitance [...] with force-based detectors"[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_cell]
How?
What is the details?
This "force-based detector" is probably Volta's condenser electrometer.

How did Volta measure current?
He did not?
He measured potentials?

In Volta's time, the concept of electric current had not yet been invented,
let alone the apparatus to measure such current.
 [fn::https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200603/history.cfm]

"Volta did not set out to invent the battery.
His experiments in this area were actually performed to show the claims of [Luigi Galvani] were wrong."
 [fn::https://www.famousscientists.org/alessandro-volta/]

Volta tried various pairs of metals,
and arranged his results into the electrochemical series,
for the metals known in his time.

How do we know that something is electrified,
besides by touching it and shocking ourselves?

"If the column contains about twenty of these couples of metal, it will be capable of giving to the fingers several small shocks."
 [fn::https://www.famousscientists.org/alessandro-volta/]
Is about 30 volts DC high enough to be felt by a human?

"The battery Volta invented gave chemists a very powerful new method to study substances."[fn::https://www.famousscientists.org/alessandro-volta/]

the most powerful electrical battery in the world at the Royal Institution."[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphry_Davy]

** Ferromagnetism: Distinguishing between electricity and magnetism
How do we distinguish between electricity and magnetism?

By the following experiment, which goes back to 1600, in Gilbert's "De Magnete" Book 2.[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Magnete]

Four things are required:
- a piece of amber rubbed to charge it,
- a piece of magnetic lodestone,
- a piece of metal, and
- and a piece of paper.

Then, we observe that the rubbed amber attracts both metal and paper,
but the lodestone attracts only metal and does not attract paper.

"[T]he English scientist William Gilbert wrote De Magnete,
in which he made a careful study of electricity and magnetism,
distinguishing the lodestone effect from static electricity produced by rubbing amber."[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electricity&oldid=904686616]

William Gilbert (1544--1603) distinguished the lodestone effect (magnetism)
from the amber effect (electricity).[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity#History]

"Electric" means "like amber[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber]".

** Substances, mixtures, and elements: How do we know?
What is a mixture?
How do we know that something is a mixture?

- If we have just created the mixture ourselves, then we know that it is a mixture.
- If something has the same properties as a mixture we created earlier, then it is a mixture.
- If a thing can be separated into several things with different chemical properties, then it is a mixture.

Each constituent of a mixture has a unique set of properties.

The properties of a mixture may greatly differ from the properties of its constituents.

If we mix sand and salt, the result is a mixture of sand and salt.
If we shake the mixture, the result is still a mixture of sand and salt.

What are the properties of a mixture?

What is the relationship between a mixture and its constituents?

/The mass of a mixture is the sum of the mass of its constituents/:
The result of mixing 1 kg salt and 2 kg water is 3 kg mixture of salt water.

Mixing is easier than separation.
It is easier to mix things into a mixture
than to separate a mixture into its constituents.

An element is a thing that is not a mixture.

How do we know that something is an element?

If we cannot separate a substance into several constituents,
how do we know whether we have reached a limit of Nature or we have merely reached a limit of our instruments?

How do we know that a thing consists of exactly one kind of chemical element?

We know that something is an element by being unable
to separate the thing into several constituents with different properties.

There are two options for verifying Boyle's law:
- One can manipulate the pressure, and measure the volume.
- One can manipulate the volume, and measure the pressure.

Manipulate the pressure, and measure the volume.
A 1 kg piston, a container, a gas, and some 1-kg weights.
Put one 1-kg weight on the piston, record the gas's volume.
Put two 1-kg weights on the piston, record the gas's volume.

In 1671, Robert Boyle discovered and described the reaction between iron filings and dilute acids, which results in the production of hydrogen gas.[63][64]
In 1766, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance, by naming the gas from a metal-acid reaction "inflammable air".
He speculated that "inflammable air" was in fact identical to the hypothetical substance called "phlogiston"[65][66] and further finding in 1781 that the gas produces water when burned.
He is usually given credit for the discovery of hydrogen as an element.[4][5]
In 1783, Antoine Lavoisier gave the element the name hydrogen (from the Greek ὑδρο- hydro meaning "water" and -γενής genes meaning "creator")[6] when he and Laplace reproduced Cavendish's finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned.[5]

A negatively-charged red-hot iron sphere leaks its negative charge (into the surrounding air),
but such sphere does not leak charges if it is positively charged.

We heat a metal, so that it emits electrons.

We keep it hot, until it emits no more electrons.

Then we cool it down.
My hypothesis is that the cool metal should now be positively charged.

What is a wave?

Photons and electrons are neither particle nor wave.
It is a categorical impossibility, a logical contradiction, for something to be both particle and wave.
*** What do we mean by "light is a wave"?
If we say "light is a wave", then we are saying that light has no objective (material) existence.
Also, what is the restoring force of this wave?

The sea has waves, but the sea is not the waves.

If we say "light behaves like a wave", then, what does it mean for an objective thing to behave like a subjective thing?

The people who thought about the luminiferous aether[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether] must have thought about this.

If the aether does not exist, then light is not a wave.

Light is electromagnetic radiation.
A disturbance in the electromagnetic field?

We must distinguish between /physical/ wave and /mathematical/ wave.

Light is not a physical wave,
but we sometimes think of light as a mathematical wave.

A wave both propagate in a medium and may diffract.
Light may diffract but propagates in vacuum?

We thought light was a wave.
It is not.
Neither is it a particle.
It /behaves like/ wave under certain circumstances,
and it /behaves like/ particle under certain circumstances,
but it is neither a particle or a wave.
*** How do we know whether there is light?
In order to see something,
we have to direct our eyes toward that thing,
and the surrounding has to be bright enough.
We can see things in broad daylight,
but we cannot see things in a cave even though it is daytime outside,
but we can bring fire with us into the cave and then we can see things again.
We can also light a fire, and then we can see things even though it is nighttime.
The light from the sun and the light from the fire has the same nature in that they both help us see;
they only have different quantities of light.
*** Can light diffract?
What do we mean by light?

Can light be detected?

Is light whatever a light detector detects?
A light detector affects the light.
*** Wave-particle duality is category error
Wave is abstract; particle is concrete.
A thing cannot be both abstract and concrete.

Wave is a kind of repetitive motion.
Particle is a small thing.

Wave is abstract, subjective, mental, conceptual, and has no objective existence.
What objectively exists is the particles and their interactions.
** Quantum mechanics?
If quantum mechanics is the answer, what is the question?

What problem does quantum mechanics solve?

Which simplifying assumptions of classical mechanics are removed by quantum mechanics?
** ? Davisson--Germer experiment
What is the details of the Davisson--Germer experiment,
"in which electrons, scattered by the surface of a crystal of nickel metal, displayed a diffraction pattern"[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davisson%E2%80%93Germer_experiment]?
** Observables?
"In systems governed by classical mechanics, it is a real-valued function on the set of all possible system states.
In quantum physics, it is an operator, or gauge, where the property of the system state can be determined by some sequence of physical operations."[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable]
Why is that so?
What is the motivation?
** Quantum statics?
What is the quantum analog of the classical statics?
What is the quantum analog of Archimedes's law of the lever?

Quantum statics should be simpler, because it should not require calculus.
** Teaching quantum mechanics: How should we introduce quantum mechanics?
Experiments must guide us because our everyday intuition breaks down.

State-space formalism of classical mechanics?
By quantizing Hamiltonian mechanics?

Sakurai 2011 \cite{sakurai2011modern} begins with Stern--Gerlach experiment[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment],
but that book is not for beginners.
Classical mechanics predicts that the collisions form a line, but reality gives us two clusters instead of a line.

Electromagnetism is required to understand the Stern--Gerlach experiment.
What is a magnetic moment?

\cite{muller2002teaching}
** Brownian-motion view of quantum-mechanical indeterminacy?
Photons are like Brown's pollens in Einstein's Brownian motion paper.
Pollens jiggle because they are hit by water particles much smaller than the pollens.

Hypothesis:
Material particles (such as electrons) appear to have indeterminate position
because they are hit by ether particles much smaller than the material particles.

What about non-localities (entanglements)?

But this is fundamentally different.
A pollen always has a position at each point in time.
A quantum particle does not have a position until it is measured.

** The meaning of probability?

There is a non-zero probability that a black hole appearing out of nowhere kills us all.
Will it happen?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Until 1912, when Max Theodor Felix von Laue, a German physicist, discovered a roundabout way of seeing the unseeable.
He did it by shooting a beam of x-rays at crystals and then analyzing the way the atoms in the crystal reflected the x-rays.
The resulting "diffraction pattern" could be seen by developing a piece of photographic film placed near the crystal.
By analyzing the pattern created by the scattered x-rays — a process requiring very complex mathematical calculations — researchers could painstakingly work out,
at least for simple crystals, the distances and angles between the atoms that comprised them.
Once the basic crystal unit involved more than a handful of atoms, however, the patterns became too complex to analyze directly.

* TODO Fields
** Fields: How do we know?
A \emph{field} assigns something to each point in space.
The \emph{gravitational field} assigns to each point a \emph{gravitational force per unit mass}.

A field is modeled by a \emph{multivariate function} (a function that takes several variables).
The variables can be grouped into a vector.
This gives the impression that the function takes one big vector instead of several scattered real numbers.

A \emph{scalar field} is a field that gives a scalar.

A \emph{vector field} is a field that gives a vector.

A field \(f\) is \emph{uniform} iff \(f(x)\) is the same for all \(x\).

How do we know whether fields are real or just a mathematical abstraction?
** Can we reverse-compute the density that causes a field?
Given a mass density scalar field, we can compute the resulting gravity vector field.

Can we do the inverse?
Given a gravity vector field, can we compute what mass density scalar field would give rise to that?

Divide the space into small cubes v0 v_1 ....
Let xk be a point anywhere in cube v_k.
\( g(x) = sum_k rho(x_k) v_k \).

How do we know which is real: the gravity field or the mass density?

* Electromagnetism
Electromagnetism unifies optics, electricity, and magnetism.
** How do we know that electricity and magnetism is the "same" phenomenon?
What do we mean by "same"?

Electric current deflects magnets (Ørsted 1???)[fn::http://www.princeton.edu/ssp/joseph-henry-project/galvanometer/explaining-the-phenomenon/oersteds-theory/].
Two electrified wires electric current running in the same direction, attract each other (Ampère ????)[fn::http://www.princeton.edu/ssp/joseph-henry-project/galvanometer/explaining-the-phenomenon/amperes-theory/].
(Do we get the signs/directions right?)

Then?
** How do we know that magnetism is caused by electrons looping?
Now we think in reverse:
Given the shape of the magnetic field of a magnetic dipole (such as a small bar magnet),
what is the shape of the electric current that produces the magnetic field with the same shape?
It's a loop! That is, a wire that forms one circle!
Thus, perhaps the magneticity of a stone is caused by a concert of aligned electrons orbiting in tiny loops?
Tiny loops of electric current acting in concert.
Each electron is racing alone in its own circuit.
Is this picture correct?

The word "spin" suggests that an electron is a ball that rotates in an axis, but
"Our concept of spin must also be adjusted to fit with the discoveries of the 20th century."[fn::https://www.rpi.edu/dept/phys/ScIT/InformationStorage/faraday/magnetism_a.html]
** Given an electron's motion, how do we infer its electromagnetic disturbance?
Suppose that an electron has position \( x(t) \) at time \( t \).
What is the travelling electromagnetic disturbance caused by the electron?

* Gases and statistics
** Statistical thinking
Statistics is about seeing the forest and ignoring the trees.

Statistics is about gaining knowledge about the population at the cost of losing knowledge about the individual.

To appreciate the relevance of statistics,
consider a box of gas with 1 billion particles.
It is impractical to model that by 1 billion equations of motion.
However, we can still say something useful,
because /statistics/ allows us to /summarize/ the gas.
With statistics, we can talk about /macroscopic behavior/,
but we can't talk about individual particles;
we get the summary but we sacrifice the details.
Now we can talk about the /distribution/ of the velocity of the particles,
such as /50% of the particles are slower than something/;
but now we cannot say anything about the individual particles.

Statistical physics is macro-physics.
The idea is we consider a statistics of the system.
We look at the big picture instead of looking at each particle.
There are many particles.
We cannot say anything about one particle.
What is an example of /statistical ensemble/?
** Gas model
We think of a gas in a container as a collection of many tiny balls with negligible mass
moving around freely according to Newton's laws of motion.

We ignore gravity?
** What
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature

** Getting used to probability and statistics
Exercise (Discrete probability):
Roll a fair six-faced die once.
What is the probability of getting the three-dotted face?

Answer: 3/6.

Exercise (Joint probability of independent events):
Roll a fair six-faced die three times.
What is the probability of getting the three-dotted face three times?

Answer: $(3/6) \times (3/6) \times (3/6)$.

A /distribution/ of a set $\Omega$ describes how members of $\Omega$ are distributed.
Let $f$ be the density of that distribution.
Then $f(x)$ describes the tendency of values to gather around $x$?
Values tend to gather near the peaks of $f$.
** What/how is Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution?
Maxwell distribution is a chi-distribution with 3 degrees of freedom.
What?
** Using the Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution of speed (for what?)
An example question that statistical physics (statistical mechanics) can answer is
"What is the probability of finding a particle with a given speed?"
For example, see the probability density function of the Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution.

Don't remember the equation.
To be a physicist, you don't need to remember this; you can always go to Wikipedia or open a book.
The important thing is that you know /what it means/ and /what it's useful for/.
The density of /Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution/ is $f(v)$.
The number $\int_A f$ describes the /probability of finding a particle
whose speed is in the set (the range) \(A\)/.
Let that sink for a moment, especially if you aren't yet comfortable with probability theory.
The density of /Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution/ is
???
\begin{align*}
    f(v) = \parenthesize{ \frac{m}{2\pi k T} }^{3/2} 4 \pi v^2 \exp \parenthesize{ - \frac{mv^2}{2kT} }
\end{align*}
Who got that? How?
** Central limit theorem
Let there be many random variables, independent.
Then, their sum tends to be normally distributed,
even if the random variables themselves are not normally distributed.
 [fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem]

The sum of normally-distributed random variables tends to be normally distributed.
** Concordances

** Temperature and radiation
Why does a heated iron glow?

Why does a body radiate when heated?

Does a heated gas glow?
Heated solid iron glows.
Heated liquid iron glows too.
Does a heated gaseous iron also glow?

A solid is not absolutely motionless.
There is a lot of micromotions.
The atoms are vibrating.

Why is a solid thing solid?

What is temperature?
A measure of how cold or hot something is.
Zero degree Celsius is the temperature at which water solidifies into ice at sea level.

Why does matter expand when heated?

Thermometers exploit the expansion of heated matter.
What we actually measure is the length of the thermometer.
The heat is measured indirectly.

Microscopically, what is temperature?
"For an ideal gas, temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the random microscopic motions of the constituent microscopic particles."

We think about the forces,
figure out the accelerations,
integrate them to get the velocities,
and integrate them to get the positions.

How does Hamiltonian mechanics explain a ball falling near the ground?
\( P = mgh \).
\( K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \).
The state of the system is \( (h, mv) \).
The operator is \( P(h, mv) = mgh \) and \( K(h, mv) = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \).
\( P + K = \text{constant} \) which means that \( \pdv{P}{h} = 0 \) and \( \pdv{K}{v} = 0 \).

Physics is mathematics + engineering + philosophy.

** Ontology
  - an attempt

    - undefined terms

      - touch

    - A /matter/ is something we can touch.

      - The air is also a matter because we can feel it with our sense of touch.
      - Problem: subjective definition

        - What about people without sense of touch?

      - Is there a definition that doesn't depend on our senses?

        - Is such definition even possible?

          - Should "matter" be undefined?

            - Is physics about explaining our perceptions?

      - A matter is something that exists?

        - But how do we know that it exists if not from our senses?

          - Is there a teapot orbiting the sun?

            - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot][WP:Russell's teapot]]

              - How do we prove non-existence?

                - Do we have to?

                  - Yes?

                    - Who claims, proves.

                      - If you claim that someone raped you, you have to prove it.
                      - Problem?

                        - If you claim that someone has /never/ raped you, you have to prove it.

                          - But how?

                            - Let there be three people X, Y, Z.
                            - Z (probably a judge in a court) doesn't know either X or Y.
                            - How does X prove, to Z, that Y has never raped X?

                              - There are things that are true but unprovable?

                                - Is God true but unprovable (if there is a coherent definition of "God")?

                          - This can be used as a joke?

                            - X: "Hey, do you know? Y has never raped me, but I can't prove it."
                            - Z: "So, what are you suggesting?"

                        - How do we prove that Y has never transferred anything to X's bank account?

                          - We assume that the bank is honest and maintains correct records.

                            - Why should Z accept this assumption?

                              - Should Z still accept this assumption if X owned the bank?

                          - The bank record is finite.
                          - Then we only need to check exhaustively whether there is anything from Y in the records.

                        - How do we prove that there isn't a teapot orbiting the sun?

                          - We can't visit every point in space.
                          - We can't exhaustive-check the entire Universe.
                          - We can't.
                          - But we can say that it's /implausible/.

                            - Why? How?
                            - What if there is really a teapot-shaped space rock orbiting the sun?

                        - How do you prove that two people have never met before?
                        - How to prove libel?

                          - Suppose:

                            - X did rape Y.
                            - Y claims that X raped Y, but can't prove it.

                          - Then can X countersue Y with libel?

                      - If you claim that God exists, you have to prove it.
                      - If you claim that God doesn't exist, you also have to prove it.
                      - If you don't claim that God exists or not, then you don't have to prove anything.
                      - If you /believe/ something, then you don't have to prove anything to others,
                        as long as you don't claim it before them.

                        - Our belief is a claim we make before ourselves.
                          If we can prove it, good for us.
                          If we can't prove it, it's our problem.
                        - But, spreading a belief is making a claim before others.
                          It has to be proven.

- Some branches of philosophy

  - Epistemology (how do we know?)
  - Ontology (what exists?)
  - Ethics (morality; what should be?)

- Epistemology

  - There are two kinds of knowledge: /prior/ and /posterior/.

    - Prior (before-the-fact) knowledge is obtained by inferring theorems from axioms through the rules of logic.
    - Posterior (after-the-fact) knowledge is obtained by observation from the real world through the physical senses.

There seem to be two kinds of substances:
- Substances that are broken down by heat: wood, etc.
- Substances whose formation requires heat: metal, sulfuric acid.

It seems to me that substances formed by heat are more dangerous.
It seems that such substances somehow absorb some of the heat used to form it,
and store that heat as its internal energy.

** Interesting things Linus Pauling said about Harvard in 1929
<2019-07-16> http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/bond/narrative/page19.html
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[In 1929, Pauling] was twenty-eight years old and flattered by the attention, but he also found things -- some big, some little -- he did not like [about Harvard].
Whereas Caltech was becoming famous for allowing researchers a free hand to develop their own unique approaches to science,
at Harvard, Pauling found, subdisciplines such as organic chemistry and physical chemistry had ossified into separate fiefdoms.
There was a sense of backbiting and politicking and a hoarding of talent he did not like.
A product of the egalitarian American West, Pauling also received his first taste of eastern class snobbery.
"Here was a society where there were a lot of important people who were important just because of birth.
They had money and stature not based on their own abilities," he remembered.
"I thought I would be a sort of second-class citizen at Harvard."

** Why cannot a broken solid be restored just by bringing the pieces close together?
A solid thing can be broken into two pieces,
but merely bringing the pieces close together does not restore
the thing into the state before it was broken,
whereas water in a bucket can be divided into two buckets
and then poured back into one bucket without any significant difference
besides making some undulations that eventually subside.

There is no need to rediscover everything in the way our ancestors did.
We have hindsight.
We should exploit the full benefit of hindsight.
But we should not trivialize the toil of our ancestors.

(End of change of opinion.)

Let's begin with very "wrong" ideas; we're "cheating" with our hindsight that our ancestors did not have.
We will revise knowledge as we go.
We will become less "wrong".

We might will never be 0% wrong.
