My "tech" stack is
Pandoc + Jekyll + Emacs(+Org+Magit) + VSCode(+Vim) + Git + Debian 9.

The page you are looking at is written in Org Mode, and then converted to HTML with a Pandoc Lua filter.

My only reason for using Org Mode is its Outline Mode.

- [[file:all.html][All pages]]: this is broken due to our migration from jekyll to pandoc.
  This does not list all pages.
  But that also means that sitemap.xml is also broken.

These are important articles, in alphabetical order.
We should prioritize finishing these articles.
- [[file:intelligence.html]]
- [[file:nature.html]]
- [[file:philo.html]]
- [[file:pnptry.html]]
- [[file:social.html]]

Intersecting topics:
- [[file:philo.html]] and [[file:intelligence.html]] intersect at "modeling".

- [[file:other.html][Unimportant content]]:
  this page badly needs massive reorganization.
  - I am regrouping the contents in this website from by-topic to by-task.
    These are pages with old grouping.
  - This page contains the old grouping that I haven't moved.
  - This page is also a staging area, a queue, a scratchpad, for the things I shall process later.
  - [[file:compsci.html][Computer science]]: page needs massive restructuring
    - Learning computer science
      - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science][WP:Computer science]]
      - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzJ46YA_RaA][YT:Map of Computer Science]]
    - [[file:compute.html][Computation]]

Perhaps I should delete these pages:

- I play piano in the band [[file:nomads.html][The Nomads]] (an Indonesian band, not the Swedish band).
  However, as of 2018-12-23, this is no longer true:
  I hate cigarette smokes and carrying pianos.
  I'm no longer a pianist; I'm now a composer with an asset mindset.
- [[file:smf.html][Standard MIDI file format]]
- [[file:forlet.html][Things I've forlet]]: goals I've abandoned
- Programming
  - Using Java
    - Building a Java project
      - 2018-08-29: For Java enterprise/server programming, I recommend Maven instead of Gradle.
- Searching
  - Where does this fit in the hierarchy?
