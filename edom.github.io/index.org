My "tech" stack is
Pandoc + Jekyll + Emacs(+Org+Magit) + VSCode(+Vim) + Git + Debian 9.

The page you are looking at is written in Org Mode, and then converted to HTML with a Pandoc Lua filter.

My only reason for using Org Mode is its Outline Mode.

  this page badly needs massive reorganization.
  - I am regrouping the contents in this website from by-topic to by-task.
    These are pages with old grouping.
  - This page contains the old grouping that I haven't moved.
  - This page is also a staging area, a queue, a scratchpad, for the things I shall process later.

Perhaps I should delete these pages:

- I play piano in the band [[file:{% link nomads.md %}][The Nomads]] (an Indonesian band, not the Swedish band).
  However, as of 2018-12-23, this is no longer true:
  I hate cigarette smokes and carrying pianos.
  I'm no longer a pianist; I'm now a composer with an asset mindset.
