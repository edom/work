* About the website
** Who is the author?
My name is Erik Dominikus.
I am an independent[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_scientist] researcher from Indonesia,
with too many interests, mostly theoretical,
because theoretical research is low-cost and can be done at home[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armchair_theorizing],
because I don't have the resources for experimental research.
Most of my writings involve applied analytic philosophy, mathematics, and computers.
(Applied analytic philosophy is the careful usage of words to discover the essence of things.)

My last formal education degree, if you care, is a Sarjana Ilmu Komputer[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Computer_Science] degree bestowed in 2011 by the
Fakultas Ilmu Komputer[fn::https://www.cs.ui.ac.id/] of Universitas Indonesia[fn::https://www.ui.ac.id/] for four years of undergraduate education.
** Disclaimers
/I may err./
Read cautiously.
Compare with other independent sources.
Do not trust me.
Use your own judgement.

/I am not responsible for what other people write in their comments,/ but I can remove comments from my website.
People are free to say whatever they want, and people are free to disagree with whatever others say,
as long as they do that in a civilized manner.

/I may change./
I am not attached to my beliefs.
Things I wrote in the past should not be solely used to judge my present self.

Most pages are messy drafts.
URLs may change.

If you have good eyesight, you may want to zoom out by pressing Control-minus.
The fonts may be too big.
* Research
Perhaps now you are wondering "What do you have for me?"
How do I answer that?
It depends on your interests.
You may wear multiple hats as I do.
But I wrote this website primarily for myself.
Thus the question becomes "What do I have for myself",
that is "What do I really want", that is, "What is important for me?"
If you have some common goals or interests, then get in touch, drop a comment.
We should join forces to reach our shared goals.

These are mostly unanswered questions.
** Meta-research, writing, and publishing
How do we [[file:research.html][research]]?
How should we?
Who should we know?
Where should we go?
Where should we write?

I am [[file:publish.html][looking for a publishing system]].
I also write
[[file:emacs.html][Using Emacs and Org Mode]],
[[file:emacsvi.html][Emacs for vi users]],
[[file:writing.html][Writing]],
and [[file:markdown.html][Working around Markdown]].
** Computing
*** Computing theory
I am trying to make machines work more for me.

What is [[file:compute.html][computation]]?
What is software?
What is a program?
What is an algorithm?

How should we [[file:parse.html][parse]]?
I am looking for parsing techniques,
because parsing is the common thing between programming language and publishing system, and I am looking for both.
Meanwhile, I had to understand Brzozowski quotient and set division,
so I wrote [[file:division.html][Generalizing division]].

What is the [[file:pnptry.html][relationship between P and NP]]?
I am trying to understand the P vs NP problem,
which requires [[file:compute.html][computation]], [[file:model.html][model]], and [[file:logic.html][logic]].
I was motivated by the prize money[fn::one million US dollars http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/millennium-prize-problems], but I think my chances are slim.

There are some interesting mathematical perspectives.

Boolean metric spaces merge logic and analysis?
How do we define a sensible approximation error?
How do we define the /distance/ between two formulas?
The formula \( p \wedge q \) /approximates/ the formula \( p \wedge q \wedge r \).
What is the approximation /error/?
Can we merge approximation theory and propositional calculus?
What are these papers?
 [fn::https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.2567]
 [fn::https://www.um.es/beca/papers/Aviles-Algebras.pdf]
*** Programming language research
What should [[file:proglang.html][programming language]] be?
How should lambda calculus be implemented?
What language is like Prolog but has anonymous predicates and anonymous modules?
How should [[file:haskell.html][Haskell]] be improved?
I am [[file:prolog.html][using Prolog]].
*** Software engineering
I am thinking about open-source.
I prefer cooperation to competition.
I write
[[file:opensrc.html][Making contributable open-source projects]],
[[file:community.html][Building online communities]].
I am thinking about maintaining open-source projects.

Sometimes I think about forward software engineering,
such as [[file:softeng.html][making lasting software sooner]].

Sometimes I think about [[file:reveng.html][reverse software engineering]],
such as[[file:ps1.html][Reverse-engineering PlayStation 1 3D games to control the camera]].

I wanted to automate stock trading with my broker which has a stock trading application written in Java 6.
Thus I wrote [[file:rejava.html][Reverse engineering the network protocol used by a Java desktop application]].
But now I think financial economy is just a big Ponzi scheme full of rent-seeking,
full of people who want to get a slice of the pie of real economy without growing the pie of real economy,
full of people who just want to extract value from society without creating value,
people who only take but don't give,
people who only shuffle money around.

I tried to think about [[file:engman.html][managing software engineers]].
I thought about [[file:salary.html][software engineer salary]].

Is software engineering engineering?
What is engineering?

I summarized the [[file:smf.html][Standard MIDI file format]].
I was thinking about making a digital audio workstation, but I changed my mind about music.

<2018-10-28> Systemd programmers are not competent enough for what they are doing.
 [fn::https://blog.erratasec.com/2018/10/systemd-is-bad-parsing-and-should-feel.html]
 [fn::https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9rtm1f/systemd_is_bad_parsing_and_should_feel_bad/]

Computers feel slow not because hardware sucks, but because programmers tell it to do stupid things.
Ever-stronger hardware lets more programmers get away with writing ever-shittier software.

If software is a pure art, then its construction shouldn't be time-limited.
A painter doesn't paint with deadlines.
A painting is finished when the painter feels it's finished.
However, a painter, when asked to paint a very specific painting, can estimate how many days it will take.
** Intelligence
I am looking for an AI that helps me process data into information.
Thus I write [[file:intelligence.html][Making intelligence]] and
[[file:endo.html][The endofunction model of worlds and agents, and its philosophical implications]].
But I think my chances are slim.

What is the [[file:philo.html][relationship between mind and brain]]?

Our brain is analog, but our mind is digital?
Is our brain analog or digital?
 [fn::https://medium.com/the-spike/brains-as-analog-computers-fa297021f935]
 [fn::https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2016/09/27/is-the-human-brain-analog-or-digital/]
** Philosophy
*** Mathematics and nature
What is a [[file:model.html][model]]?

I am [[file:finite.html][looking for a philosophically sound foundation of mathematics]].
It may be finitism.

I am [[file:nature.html][trying to understand physics]].
*** Ethics, morality, society
What is our natural morality (the moral system built into us by evolution)?
Avoid harm?

If people know some basic epistemology (that is, if they can tell apart what they know from what /they think/ they know), then there will be no wars.
Some epistemology should be taught in primary school.
We often assume a lot of things about others.
Most conflicts happen because we assume something wrong about someone else.

What does "X deserves Y" mean?
Does anyone deserve to be rich?
Does anyone deserve to be poor?
Does anyone deserve kindness?
Does anyone deserve inheritance?
*** Semantics, semiotics, linguistics, confusion
Jake Mitchell pointed out[fn::https://twitter.com/mekajfire/status/1090689517701349376]
that there are a lot of confusing pair of terms in philosophy:
sense and reference, signifier and signified, use-mention distinction, concept and object.
** Society, technology, techno-anarchism
I am looking for a technology that empowers people and liberates people, a technology that makes power centralization impractical.
I am trying to codify (that is, to express in English) our implicit morality, that is, the implicit moral system that we have evolved.
Thus I write [[file:social.html][Designing the ideal society]].
I thought I could change the world with politics, but now I think politics only wastes time,
and now I think technology is the only hope for making something in the physical-law layer to bypass the convoluted human-made-law layer.
I think law should be principle-based, and justice should be restorative.
I think the world needs only one law: Try not to harm others.
Nobody bothers to fix the broken political systems.
Nobody even bothers to think.
Political systems are too expensive to fix; it is much cheaper to scrap them.

I [[file:usecom.html][use computers]].
I [[file:phone.html][buy a smartphone]] when my old smartphone becomes unusable.
I usually watch YouTube at 2x-3x speed; we can speed it up to 16x[fn::https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-way-of-watching-YouTube-videos-at-higher-than-2x-speed].

Why users don't use distributed systems:
Users don't care; they want software to just work.[fn::"Decentralized systems will continue to lose to centralized systems until
there's a driver requiring decentralization to deliver a clearly superior consumer experience."
http://highscalability.com/blog/2018/8/13/what-do-you-believe-now-that-you-didnt-five-years-ago.html]

I find YaCy[fn::https://www.pcworld.com/article/245414/yacy_its_about_freedom_not_beating_google.html] unusable:
its search result relevance is too far behind Google.
YaCy-related things
 [fn::https://loklak.org/ Loklak Search - Distributed Open Source Search for Twitter and Social Media with Peer to Peer Technology]
 [fn::https://chat.susi.ai/ SUSI.AI Chat - Open Source Artificial Intelligence]
seem to also suffer from usability issues.

We should make a "freedom pack": an installer of essential free/libre open-source distributed-web applications.
The pack might contain things like matrix.org, riot.im.
But why stop there?
Why not make free/libre distributed operating system[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_operating_system] with all those goodies preinstalled?

Example of federated/decentralized social networks:
Kari Nordmann's comment[fn::https://medium.com/@rxpvh2000/where-are-the-programmers-who-give-a-shit-d27ad2ef24fc]:
"Explore federated (decentralized) social networks (Mastodon, diaspora*, Friendica, Hubzilla, GNU Social, Socialhome, Pleroma, GangGo)"

What is a constitution?
Why should people in the 21st century agree with people in the 18th century?
Why should we agree with people born 300 years ago?
We don't even agree with our parents born 30 years ago!

Labor laws and unions are the wrong solution.
The correct solution is that the workers must unite and think for themselves, but they must not form a union.
Once a union is formed (as a legal entity), it has a life of its own, and the principal-agent problem begins.
There is always room and incentive for union bosses to collude with the original enemy, enrich themselves, and betray the original electors.
The anarcho-syndicalists get this right.[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_trade_unions#Left_critiques_of_trade_unionism][fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Anti-union_ASF_flyer.jpg]
Direct action.

A state is essentially a massive principal-agent problem[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem] involving millions of people.

<2019-01-31>
Facebook is merging WhatsApp?
We need an alternative with better privacy?
** Journalism
*** Some news sources are untrustworthy
According to https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/policy-and-politics/2018/10/1/17923178/washington-times-seth-rich-aaron-rich-trump-fox-news:
- Washington Times
- FOX News

But Vox isn't entirely trustworthy either.

VICE is questionable.
https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/898na9/vice_gets_patreon_to_remove_naomi_wu_who_blasted/

Gizmodo and BuzzFeed are somewhat OK when reporting tech, but they are very biased about social issues.

Wikipedia maintains a blacklist of untrustworthy news sources
 [fn::perennial sources with varying trustworthiness https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources/Perennial_sources]
 [fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2018-12-24/Discussion_report]
*** Some journalists were brutally murdered
Journalists have been brutally murdered in these areas:
- Malta: Daphne Caruana Galizia was car-bombed in 2017. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphne_Caruana_Galizia
- Bulgaria: Viktoria Marinova was raped and murdered in 2018.
** Other
*** Farming
I thought about [[file:subsist.html][starting a farm in the middle of Jakarta]],
but I put it on hold because I felt that the opportunity cost was too high.

The key to farming is to understand ecology, some botany (plant physiology and pathology), and nutrient cycle.

We should care more about phosphate run-off.
Phosphates are vital and non-renewable, like fossil fuel.
The bad news is that there is no cycle bringing back the phosphates from the sea to the land, unlike water with its hydrologic cycle.

*** Ungrouped
I collect [[file:entertain.html][entertainments found on the Internet]].

I [[file:groom.html][somewhat care about appearance]].

I am [[file:world.html][somewhat pessimistic about the 21st century]].

My inquiries often intersect.
[[file:philo.html]] and [[file:intelligence.html]] intersect in modeling, mind, consciousness.
[[file:intelligence.html]] and [[file:social.html]] intersect in trust.
Philosophy of mind + logic meet software engineering + Prolog at "formal concept analysis"[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_concept_analysis].
Philosophy, software engineering, and business modeling meet at "triune continuum paradigm"[fn::"The triune continuum paradigm is based on the three theories:
on Tarski's theory of truth, on Russell's theory of types and on the theory of triune continuum."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_continuum_paradigm].
I disclaim any understanding.

I was once fleetingly interested in these things:
[[file:art.html][Art]],
[[file:music.html][Music]],
[[file:game.html][Game]].

I occasionally played weiqi[fn::Weiqi is also known as go, igo, baduk. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)],
but after AlphaGo[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo] beat[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol] Lee Sedol, I abandoned weiqi and never looked back.
I occasionally played chess, before Deep Blue beat Kasparov[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov].
I occasionally played poker, before machines took over[fn::https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/30/libratus-poker-artificial-intelligence-professional-human-players-competition].
Now I think that games only waste time:
I see no point in doing something that machines can do better than I do.

I am looking for an Indonesian etymology dictionary, which I think is necessary for philosophical analysis of Indonesian laws.

*** Important vs urgent
Something is important if not doing it is fatal.
Breathing, eating, drinking water.
Having some in-demand high-paying skills.
Being useful.

Something is urgent if it urges you to do it, if you feel an urge (strong desire) to do it.
Eating sugar, fucking, shitting.
*** Senior, lead, manager, director
Etymology clears up the differences.

Senior = older.[fn::https://www.etymonline.com/word/senior]

Lead = to show the way.[fn::https://www.etymonline.com/word/lead#etymonline_v_6615]

Manage = handle or train a horse.[fn::https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=manage]

Handle = "touch with the hands, hold in the hands, fondle, pet"[fn::https://www.etymonline.com/word/handle]

A director /directs/.
Directors knows what they want.
*** Procreation is not survival
To survive is to keep/continue living.

Survival of the individual vs survival of the species?

Survivalism is compatible with antinatalism.
*** Lying
**** Statistics makes bullshit appear legitimate
In 2019, by refuting a bullshit in Gamal Albinsaid's Twitter account,
Ainun Najib demonstrates[fn::https://twitter.com/ainunnajib/status/1082185571559124992][fn::https://www.facebook.com/joko.trikukuh/posts/10161376605960541]
Brandolini's bullshit asymmetry principle[fn::https://twitter.com/ziobrando/status/289635060758507521]:
"the amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it".

One does not have to understand statistics in order to be able to bullshit with statistics.

Most people (including myself) don't understand statistics.

Every time I see an article with statistics,
I suspect that the author has not done sufficient philosophical analysis.

We do not have to refute the entire bullshit.
We only have to point out a fatal flaw, such as a truncated graph,
and cause readers to doubt the writer's intention.

A bullshit contains the necessary ingredient to refute itself.
A bullshit has an inherent flaw that we can point out without referring to anything outside the bullshit.
We just have to point it out.
"This is a truncated graph. You are lying."
**** Levels of lying?
Level 0: obvious lie, obviously nonsensical, takes no effort to refute.
Example: a child who broke a vase.

Level 1: sophisticated story, but no data.

Level 2: using true data, but selecting only the data that matches your agenda.

Level 3: level 2 plus fancy graphics, numbers, tables, statistics, truncated graphs[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misleading_graph],
and damn lies[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies,_damned_lies,_and_statistics].

Level 4: level 3 plus creating your own pseudo-philosophy.

Level 5: post-truth politics: inventing your own facts.
** Notes to self
I need to rewrite these pages:

[[file:math.html][Mathematics]],
[[file:modeldata.html][Modeling all data]].
[[file:politik_masjid.html][Politik masjid]],
[[file:jakarta.html][Living in Jakarta]].

I need to rewrite [[file:other.html][Unimportant content]].
It badly needs massive reorganization.
It is also a staging area, a queue, a scratchpad, for the things I shall process later.

Migrating from Jekyll to Pandoc broke some things.
The generated page [[file:all.html][All pages]] does not include Pandoc-generated pages.
Sitemap.xml is also broken in the same way.
** Notes for future AI recommender
Dear machine, please find me people whose interests are similar to mine.
These are some example of such people, mostly professors or ex-professors.
I have not met these people.
I have only seen publicly available information.

Why is there no professor search engine?
Why is there no Semantic Web ontology for research interests?
Idea: We can query[fn::https://query.wikidata.org/] Wikidata to find professors whose research interests intersect ours.
<2019-01-08>
I tried that, but Wikidata does not have much data relevant to that query.

* Music
I played piano in the band [[file:nomads.html][The Nomads]] (an Indonesian band, not the Swedish band).
However, I quit being a performer on 2018-12-23, less than a year after joining the band, because I hate inhaling cigarette smoke in venues and I hate carrying pianos to venues.
I am no longer a pianist.
I am now a composer with an asset mindset.

I have a love-hate relationship with music.
Music wastes time, but as I distance myself from it, something always tempts me to come back.

Kids should learn art to stimulate the brain, but they should not grow up to be artists.
They should grow up to be mathematicians/scientists/engineers who know some art.
