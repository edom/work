* My story?
<2019-12-12>

I am torn between many unrelated desires lingering in my mind for too long.
I want to understand consciousness.
I want to create a programming language.
I want to understand physics.
I want to compose music.
And so on; I wrote down my desires, spanning several pages.

Why do I want those?
Why can't I just want one thing?
Do I really want those, or do I just want to be busy; do I just want to want, and not actually do what I want?
Even though I am not a materialist, I am no better than materialists;
Both of us are tormented by our own desires.

Materialism and capitalism have outlived their usefulness and overstayed their welcome.

I think nations hamper scientific research.
There should be either one world government, one currency, and one law; or there should be none at all.

I made a [[file:plan.html][plan]], but I didn't stick to it.
Aim for the moon, they say.
I enjoyed aiming too much and never took a shot.
I enjoy my imagination more than my reality.
I can stay at bed for hours just imagining pleasant things; why can't I live in my own imagination?
Am I not imagining things strong enough?

I don't think I ever have any strong urge to live.
I am interested in the afterlife.

I want to know the truth.

I am not attached to our beliefs.
Things I wrote in the past should not be solely used to judge my present self.

Most pages are messy drafts.
* Spirituality
** Universal love is the only way out
<2019-12-20>

In a capitalist society, companies enslave workers.

In a communist society, the state enslaves workers.
 [fn::<2019-12-20> https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/communism-computing-china/workethic.html]

In an anarchistic society, powerful people enslave workers.

Thus, in all societies of various ideologies and systems, the powerful entities enslave the powerless entities. All societies are suffering from centralization of power. On the other hand, if power is not centralized, then anyone can take matters into their own hands.

The only way out of slavery is that every human must see others as he sees himself. If he can see others as he sees himself, he will treat others as he treats himself, and he will love others as he loves himself. Nothing outside humans is going to erase slavery. No system is going to erase slavery. No law is going to erase slavery. Even after all work has been relegated to machines, slavery will continue to exist as long as a human does not see others as he sees himself.

If all humans have universal love, then anarchy is the best society: they will not do evil even if there are no laws.

If every human loves others as he loves himself, he will not hurt others as he will not hurt himself; he will not steal from others as he does not steal from himself; he will not kill others as he will not kill himself.

Universal love is required for anarchy to work.

If we have universal love, then anarchy is the best society.

The thing that we must fix is not countries or companies.

/We/ ourselves are what we must fix.

** Notes for future AI recommender
Dear machine, please find me people whose interests are similar to mine.
These are some example of such people, mostly professors or ex-professors.
I have not met these people.
I have only seen publicly available information.

Why is there no professor search engine?
Why is there no Semantic Web ontology for research interests?
Idea: We can query[fn::https://query.wikidata.org/] Wikidata to find professors whose research interests intersect ours.
<2019-01-08>
I tried that, but Wikidata does not have much data relevant to that query.

** Which inquiries intersect?
My inquiries often intersect.
[[file:philo.html]] and [[file:intelligence.html]] intersect in modeling, mind, consciousness.
[[file:intelligence.html]] and [[file:social.html]] intersect in trust.
Philosophy of mind + logic meet software engineering + Prolog at "formal concept analysis"[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_concept_analysis].
Philosophy, software engineering, and business modeling meet at "triune continuum paradigm"[fn::"The triune continuum paradigm is based on the three theories:
on Tarski's theory of truth, on Russell's theory of types and on the theory of triune continuum."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_continuum_paradigm].
I disclaim any understanding.

** Site map (was goal tree)
Goal tree is similar to /work breakdown structure/[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure]
and /product breakdown structure/[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_breakdown_structure].
- WBS = goal tree + 100% rule + mutual exclusivity + procedural.
- PBS = WBS - procedural + declarative.

<2019-07-06>
I am tired of planning and thinking top-down.
Now I'm trying to think bottom-up, reactive, improvisatory, opportunistic.
** Ideas that don't work?
*** <2019-08-21> Cooling with ice bottles
Should we just buy a portable air conditioner, or a big fan with misting capability?

https://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node118.html

https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/27yfbd/cooling_a_room_with_ice_and_a_fan_does_it_even/
https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-calculate-how-much-ice-you-need-to-cool-down-a-room-using-thermodynamics
https://burakkanber.com/blog/cooling-a-room-with-2-liters-of-ice-calculation/

Ignoring humidity, we want to cool 10x3x3 = 90 m3 of air from 33 deg C to 27 deg C using ice blocks.

Assume that the heat capacity of air is 0.001 J / cm3 / K = 1 MJ / m3 / K
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity#Table_of_specific_heat_capacities

Thus we have to remove 90 m3 * 6 K * 1 MJ / m3 / K = 540 MJ of heat from the air in the room.

Some thermal conductivity parameters at 1 bar in watt per meter per kelvin
[fn::http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Tables/thrcn.html]:
- ice is 1.6
- air at 33 deg C is 0.02684[fn::https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/air-properties-viscosity-conductivity-heat-capacity-d_1509.html]
- water between 0 and 33 deg C is about 0.58
- aluminum is 205.0
- 1 bar is approximately 1 atm

To feel comfortable while resting, we must constantly dissipate heat at a rate of about 90 watts.[fn::<2019-10-27> http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/coobod.html]

Although the ice bottle project did not bear fruit, I learned something for building my next house.
*** <2019-08-27> On the nuclear option
There have been several nuke-related ideas:
Nuke /subduction plates/ to prevent big earthquakes;
Nuke /hurricanes/ to stop them[fn::https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49471093];
Nuke /asteroids/ to prevent them from crashing into Earth.
But they all suffer from one problem: The nuke we have in 2019 is too weak for those purposes.

<2019-08-19> Idea: Explode atomic bombs at subduction plates to prevent bigger earthquakes.
Won't work[fn::https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/4825/will-a-nuclear-bomb-stop-an-earthquake-from-happening]

But isn't it just a matter of making bigger bombs?
It is possible in principle.
We can leave it to the engineers; it's just a matter of time before they build a bomb big enough to move subduction plates.

It reminds me of George Carlin's saying: "The planet is fine. The people are fucked."

** My doomer music playlist
*** To sink into the ocean of doom
May these musical pieces be of some consolation to fellow doomers.

"Oblivion", by Astor Piazzolla.

"Can't say goodbye to yesterday", by Rika Muranaka, sung by Carla White.

These two songs are American songs with lush orchestral background.

"Yesterdays", sung by Ella Fitzgerald.

"My romance", Mel TormÃ©.
Mel's suave light voice and the lush orchestral background.

"Yesterday", The Beatles.

"Yesterday when I was young", sung by Matt Monro.

"Fragile", by Sting.

"Gabriel's Oboe", by Ennio Morricone.

"Lacrimosa", from "Requiem", by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

"Seacht suÃ¡ilcÃ­ na Maighdine Muire", Aoife NÃ­ Fhearraigh.

"The best is yet to come", by Rika Muranaka, sung by Aoife NÃ­ Fhearraigh.

"Sorry seems to be the hardest word", Blue featuring Elton John.

"God rest you merry gentlemen".
For this song, I prefer the Aeolian mode, some inverted chords, a tempo of about 60 bpm,
and a conservative solemn arrangement that does not try too hard to impress the listener.
There is also Annie Lennox's interesting arrangement, although I would prefer its harmony to be in Aeolian mode.

"My way", Elvis Presley.

"End of the world", Aphrodite's Child.
*** To float in the ocean of doom
These are a little upbeat.

But no matter how hard one tries, one eventually sinks into the ocean of doom,
into eternal oblivion, into the nothingness that he came from.

"The unsung war", Ace Combat 5.

"Liberation of Gracemeria", Ace Combat 6.
An interesting rhythmic invention; that syncopated ostinato is genius.
It still feels satisfying even after many replays.

"Follow me", Pat Metheny.

"Fairy tales", Anita Baker.

"Are you real?", Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers.

"I'm Mr Jody", Marvin Sease.

"All rise", Blue.

"Asman", Gulnur Satylganova.

"Wakare no yokan", Teresa Teng.

"Toki wo kakeru shoujo", Harada Tomoyo.

The NAAFP (National Association for the Advancement of Fat People) anthem from Family Guy.
Beautiful harmony.
I love the IV-III7-vi progression (in the "god's man-boobs are flabby and they hurt when he jogs" part).

Movement 1 of BWV 1052 (Harpsichord concerto in D minor), Johann Sebastian Bach.

Russian national anthem.
* Games
** <2019-08-24> How does the player know what kills Crash in Crash Bandicoot?
Although the game never explicitly instructs players about what things would kill Crash,
players seem to have an /instinct/ or /intuition/ about such things.
For example, animals, traps, fires, and falling would kill Crash.
Players seem to /just know/ how to play the game.
But that is only because the dangerous things in the game world /correspond/ to dangerous things in the real world;
thus players /already know/.
It seems that /most/ adult humans know /some/ ways of avoiding death:
If doing something kills you, then simply don't do it.

The polar opposite is Minecraft:
Even with instructions, players still take time to find out how to play the game.

Interesting point of view:
"[...] Don't overreach.
You don't get /rich/ by investing.
You get rich by doing whatever you're doing, and investing is about /preserving/ what you made elsewhere and /growing/ it.
It's when you get greedy about trying to make that killing on your investment that you tend to overreach."

* Other things
** Why do you make this website?
Because I find thinking, writing, and planning fun.
This website contains questions that I think should be answered.

I think of myself as three different people:
- my past self
- my present self
- my future self

This website is a way for those three people to communicate.
** Who are you?
I am an independent[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_scientist] researcher from Indonesia,
with too many interests, mostly theoretical,
because theoretical research is low-cost and can be done at home[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armchair_theorizing],
because I don't have the resources for experimental research.
Most of my writings involve applied analytic philosophy, mathematics, and computers.
(Applied analytic philosophy is the careful usage of words to discover the essence of things.)

My last formal education degree, if you care, is a Sarjana Ilmu Komputer[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Computer_Science] degree bestowed in 2011 by the
Fakultas Ilmu Komputer[fn::https://www.cs.ui.ac.id/] of Universitas Indonesia[fn::https://www.ui.ac.id/] for four years of undergraduate education.
** Should I trust you?
/No, you should not./
Anyone can put anything on the Internet.
Judge for yourself.
More disclaimers follow.
** How should I interact with you?
You can pick one of these:
- Leave a Disqus comment in the related page.
- [[https://github.com/edom/edom.github.io/issues][Open an issue at GitHub]].

Expect long delay.
If you don't get a reply after waiting for a few days,
try resending your message.
It does get lost sometimes.

If you are in Jakarta, we may meet in some meetups.
** Where else are you?
I may also be found at these places, but I rarely check them:

** What are some similar websites?
These are some websites similar to this website and their differences.

[[https://kevinbinz.com/][kevinbinz.com]] is more like a blog than a wiki.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/][en.wikipedia.org]] does not want original content.
(Also, if [[https://www.quora.com/Will-it-be-feasible-to-move-Wikipedia-mediaWiki-from-PHP-to-some-modern-language-like-Golang][Kelly Kinkade's answer]] is true, then it's worrying that so much human knowledge is stored in such unparseable MediaWiki markup language.)

TheBrain: the idea is good, but the app is slower than static web.

[[https://www.brainpickings.org][brainpickings.org]]:
too social, too much content, too little navigation, too little structure;
pop science content is too much pop and too little science.

<2019-11-05>

[[https://glennelert.us/][Glenn Elert]] writes online [[https://hypertextbook.com/][hypertext books]] similar in spirit to this website.
** Why we don't computer to be "smart"
Because we can't fix them when they're wrong.

For example, Org Mode turns a link to an image if the URL ends with an image extension like jpg, svg.
But I want a link.
And Wikimedia Commons URL has image extensions but refers to an HTML page displaying an image file, not the image file itself.
I can't do that because Org tries to be too smart.
Org should have required the user to explicitly tell whether the user wants an image.
