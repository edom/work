There are two kinds of things here.

- There are things I think of when I am too optimistic,
and then I realize that they are hard,
and then I abandon them,
but I can't really let go of them yet.
- There are things that are not big enough to have their own article.

## Grow seaweed at home

Nori is edible seaweed species of the red algae genus _Pyropia_ ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nori)).
_Porphyra_ is known as nori in Japan
([Wikipedia again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laver_(seaweed))).
What?
Which is right?
[Phycology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phycology) is the study of algae.
It turns out [nori cultivation is hard](http://www.seaweed.ie/aquaculture/noricultivation.php).
Chickens are more complex organisms than algae,
but why is raising algae harder than raising chickens?

## Walking

Proper walking increases mood.

Hypothesis:
proper walking minimizes the sum of
the magnitudes of the [jerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_%28physics%29)s of all joints.

Things to do:

- land with the ball of the feet
- fix the anterior pelvic tilt
