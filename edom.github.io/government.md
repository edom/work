- Important and urgent things for most (if not all) countries on Earth to do as soon as possible:
    - Political system
        - Restrict the form of all political campaigns to text containing the list of things the candidate wants to do.
            - Avoid pandering and toxic campaigns.
        - Replace parliaments with sortition (randomly choosing people)?
            - TED: "What if we replaced politicians with randomly selected people? | Brett Hennig", [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUee1I69nFs)
            - [WP:Sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition)
            - Will sortition work in a homogeneous country?
            Won't it just promote groupthink?
            - How does sortition affect the minority?
            How should the population be sampled?
            Stratified sampling?
    - Justice system
        - Legislators, please change the justice system from retributive justice to restorative justice for the non-violent criminals.
            - Instead of locking up prisoners, let them repair the harm they did, and help them reintegrate into society.
            - Millions of people are being incarcerated.
            Their ability is being wasted.
            They are deprived of future.
            They will have difficulties reintegrating into society.
            Stigmatized.
            Like the homeless.
            This stigma makes it impossible for them to get financial stability and get out of the vicious circle of crime.
                - Also, prison initiation rituals are terrible.
            - There are two kinds of criminals:
                - *Perforce criminals* commit crime to defend themselves from immediate bodily harm that threatens their existence.
                Examples are hungry moneyless people who steal food, and cornered people who kill.
                The solution is restorative justice, and giving work to the criminal for financial stability, helping them reintegrate into society.
                    - If the threat is removed, perforce criminals no longer commit crime.
                - *Non-perforce criminals* commit crime for anything else.
                Examples are psychopaths (people with physical inability to weigh bad consequences because their brains are wired differently).
                The solution is eugenics: modify them by gene therapy or psychological therapy or whatever technology, or kill them if they can't change,
                but only after we have proven that they can't change.

            - Prisons should not exist.
            There should exist only two kinds of punishment:
                - Forced labor, for perforce criminals, to repair the harm they did.
                The state must also help them reintegrate into society.
                - Death penalty, for non-perforce criminals.
            - In any case, nobody should be locked up for so long.
            Locking up people wastes resource.

## A government is to maximize the well-being of its people

- A government is to:
    - do things that benefit many but do not benefit a few, such as building roads;
    - prevent things that benefit few but do not benefit many, such as committing crime.
- A government is to minimize negative [externality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality)
and [rent-seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking).
- A government is to prevent the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).

## Ungrouped content

A modern government is designed to minimize the damage if a bad person rises to the top,
not to maximize the benefit if a good person rises to the top.
That is why a republic has checks and balances.
The most efficient government is a benevolent competent dictator,
but does such person exist?

The government is a monopoly, and it should seek profit for its stakeholders: all its people.
Government official corruption, similar to corporate management corruption,
is a [principal-agent problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem).
Everything that solves the principal-agent problem also solves corruption.

## A quadrant

- Does it benefit many people?
- Does it benefit a few people?

Things that benefit many and benefit few are best left to the private sector
with as little regulation as needed to keep the market healthy.

Things that benefit many but disadvantage few should be done by the public sector,
because the private sector will not do them because they don't get money doing that.
Example: building road.

Things that disadvantage many but benefit few should be prevented by the government.
Example: rent-seeking (bribing, lobbying,
speculation of non-fungible goods such as land parcels and Internet domain names),
crime, terrorism.

Things that disadvantage many and disadvantage few should also be discouraged by the government.
Example: road rage, human stupidity.

## Tips from our ancestors

I do not always agree with Lenin, but I agree with this sentence of his:

> When it is not immediately apparent which political or social groups,
> forces or alignments advocate certain proposals, measures, etc.,
> one should always ask: "Who stands to gain?"
>
> Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov a.k.a. Lenin (1870--1924)
> ([source](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/apr/11.htm))

That was 1913.
In 1976 that could be more simply put as [follow the money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follow_the_money).

## Ramble

- A government should only do things that better its people.
    - How do we know if something will make people better off?

- The public sector is inefficient, but the private sector might be too efficient (extracting too much profit? but how much profit is too much?)?
Is there a mixture between the two?

    - Definitely not the general practitioners (non-specialist doctors).
    They charge the patient only about $20 per visit.
