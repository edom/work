## A government is to maximize the well-being of its people

(Easier said than done.)

A government is to:

- do things that benefit many but do not benefit a few, such as building roads;
- prevent things that benefit few but do not benefit many, such as committing crime.

A government is to minimize negative [externality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality)
and [rent-seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking).

A government is to prevent the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).

## Ungrouped content

A modern government is designed to minimize the damage if a bad person rises to the top,
not to maximize the benefit if a good person rises to the top.
That is why a republic has checks and balances.
The most efficient government is a benevolent competent dictator,
but does such person exist?

The government is a monopoly, and it should seek profit for its stakeholders: all its people.
Government official corruption, similar to corporate management corruption,
is a [principal-agent problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem).
Everything that solves the principal-agent problem also solves corruption.

## A quadrant

- Does it benefit many people?
- Does it benefit a few people?

Things that benefit many and benefit few are best left to the private sector
with as little regulation as needed to keep the market healthy.

Things that benefit many but disadvantage few should be done by the public sector,
because the private sector will not do them because they don't get money doing that.
Example: building road.

Things that disadvantage many but benefit few should be prevented by the government.
Example: rent-seeking (bribing, lobbying,
speculation of non-fungible goods such as land parcels and Internet domain names),
crime, terrorism.

Things that disadvantage many and disadvantage few should also be discouraged by the government.
Example: road rage, human stupidity.

## Tips from our ancestors

I do not always agree with Lenin, but I agree with this sentence of his:

> When it is not immediately apparent which political or social groups,
> forces or alignments advocate certain proposals, measures, etc.,
> one should always ask: "Who stands to gain?"
>
> Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov a.k.a. Lenin (1870--1924)
> ([source](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/apr/11.htm))

That was 1913.
In 1976 that could be more simply put as [follow the money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follow_the_money).

## Ramble

- A government should only do things that better its people.
    - How do we know if something will make people better off?
