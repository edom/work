* What is Eclipse?
Not to be confused:
- Eclipse Foundation
- Eclipse Platform
- Eclipse SDK (Platform + JDT + PDE)
- Eclipse IDEs (Platform + plugins such as JDT)
- Eclipse p2 is used to "Install New Software".
- Eclipse working groups
- Eclipse projects

Wikipedia explains Eclipse better than Eclipse explains itself?
 [fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Foundation]

What projects are in the Eclipse Foundation?
Wikipedia answers this better than Eclipse itself does.

No Eclipse events in Asia.
Eclipse events seem to be mostly in Europe.

Eclipse is like Emacs but in Java instead of Elisp.

There seems to be a trend of companies "donating" projects, that they no longer want,
to non-profit foundations such as the Eclipse Foundation and the Apache Foundation.

Apache Foundation also has lots of Java projects.
What is the difference between Eclipse Foundation and Apache Foundation?

"tl;dr Apache is no longer the place projects go to die and Eclipse is expanding from just IDEs."[fn::http://insightfullogic.com/2013/Oct/12/resurgence-apache-and-eclipse/]

https://www.eclipse.org/org/councils/roadmap_v6_0/

Strategic focus areas: cloud native Java, IoT and edge, automotive, tools[fn::https://www.eclipse.org/membership/documents/eclipse-foundation-overview.pdf].
"no GPL or AGPL".

"Our community is innovating on the next generation of cloud native developer tools."
Does that mean that they will "abandon" the Java IDE?

They are de-emphasizing Java?

They missed the JavaScript boat?[fn::smrtinsert https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16940646]

They are going to focus on Orion and the Web.

"Eclipse tools have historically had a very strong correlation with the Java language.
However, with the rapid growth of Rich Internet Application languages and technologies such as JavaScript and Ajax, the Eclipse community must support the requirements of these developers as well.
Eclipse will begin to invest in re-tooling the Eclipse platform with the needs of Web developers in mind."

What's with all that IoT?
Is that where the money is?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
2011 will see another release of the Eclipse 4 stream, Eclipse 4.1. The major goals of this new release include:

- Making it easier to write plug-ins
- Allowing better control over the look of Eclipse based products
- Increasing diversity of contributors to the platform
- Maintaining backward compatibility for API-clean clients
#+END_QUOTE


mature = dead?

'Then I read the Eclipse forums and found out that there was a major UI redesign with no automated testing and very little manual testing, and the reason was "unfortunately there's no budget for testing".
This was the word of the actual official devs, by the way. They decided to do a massive rewrite without testing. It boggles the mind.'[fn::the_af https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16940646]

<2019-06-23>
It has been around for 17 years (since 2001[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software)]) and is still active as of 2019,
and it won't die soon.

Don't invest in some technology that is going to be abandoned 10 years later.

We have two choices:
- Invest in shitty technology that has been around for 20 years and doesn't seem to die any time soon.
- Pick a new rad thing that God knows how long it will survive.

Like it or not, Java is here to stay.
Nobody is going to be too eager to rewrite all their legacy code.
After all, those legacy code has been working fine.

All code becomes legacy as soon as it is written.[fn::https://leejo.github.io/2016/02/22/all_software_is_legacy/]

They will "abandon" the Java IDE; move people to other projects, every bug will be wontfix
"Our community is innovating on the next generation of cloud native developer tools."
** How do I know whether a project is not dead?
To find whether a project is not dead, look at two things: its Git stats[fn::https://git.eclipse.org/c/] and its Bugzilla stats[fn::https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/].
** How to contribute?
https://wiki.eclipse.org/Category:How_to_Contribute

What is the code contribution process/workflow?

- component owner

Bug reporting FAQ[fn::https://wiki.eclipse.org/Bug_Reporting_FAQ]:
- "What is the difference between Severity and Priority?"
  - Severity is assigned by a user.
    Priority is assigned by the developer/committer.
    Yes, there do exist P5 blockers[fn::https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?bug_severity=blocker&list_id=18791338&priority=P5&query_format=advanced]
    and P1 enhancements[fn::https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?bug_severity=enhancement&list_id=18791337&priority=P1&query_format=advanced].

"If the cost/benefit ratio of a bug does not change, it may remain unaddressed forever."

There are too many issues and too few people to work on them.
Committers are overloaded and are under time pressure of their release schedule.

What conventions?
"helpwanted" keyword?
What is the difference between "bugday" and "helpwanted"?
Which one is for beginner?
Issues marked with "bugday" are friendly to absolute beginners.
Issues marked with "helpwanted" is the next step.

** Code contribution workflow
There are two workflows:
- Bugzilla-first (talk first act later)
- Gerrit-first (act first talk later)

If your change is big, discuss it on Bugzilla first.

Use SSH to connect to Gerrit and push experimental commits.[fn::https://wiki.eclipse.org/Gerrit]

Must we make a Bugzilla issue before we push to Gerrit for review?
Must every Gerrit review have a Bugzilla issue?
No.

"Once a Gerrit change set is created, the link to the Gerrit change should be posted on the Bugzilla.
If you are using the correct commit format, this is done automatically by the Eclipse infrastructure."[fn::https://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform/How_to_Contribute]

But what if I just want to test my commits without notifying anyone, because the commits are still sketchy?

After Gerrit, EGit Bot automatically creates a continuous-integration build for the patch set.
We can see build errors here before pushing to production and embarrassing ourselves.
Cool!
** Set up Gerrit
Follow the wiki[fn::https://wiki.eclipse.org/Gerrit].
- Upload SSH public key to Gerrit.[fn::https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/settings/ssh-keys]

If you still can't connect, file a bug in "Community > Gerrit"[fn::https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Community&component=Gerrit].
Sometimes you can't connect to Gerrit.[fn::https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=548554]

** Development tools
Install "e4 spies" from the marketplace.[fn::https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/e4-spies]
There are several spies in that package.[fn::https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipsePlatformDevelopment/article.html#eclipse_ide_spies]

Use Plugin Spy (Shift+Alt+F1) to find where to insert menus, modify Eclipse Platform UI, etc.

Menu Spy (Shift+Alt+F2)
** The code?
https://wiki.eclipse.org/Status_Handling_Best_Practices
* How do I install the Platform plugin that I am developing so that it overrides/shadows/replaces the version that comes with Eclipse?
First, make sure that your plugin will not prevent you from booting Eclipse.
You can /self-host/ (run another Eclipse instance from your Eclipse instance).
As simple selecting a file in your plugin, and then Run > Debug As > Eclipse Application (or press F11 if that is already selected).

Then, use this menu:
File > Export > Plug-in Development > Deployable plug-ins and fragments > Install into host.
This is in the help that comes with Eclipse:
Help > Help Contents > Plug-in Development Environment Guide > Tasks > PDE UI > Export and Install into the Running Host.

How do we know that our plugin is installed?

Help > About > Installation Details. (or Ctrl+3 "ins det")

That feature is very handy: No need to understand P2.
If anything breaks, nuke the Eclipse installation, and reinstall everything.

What if it breaks?
It can be reverted.
 [fn::https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_Revert_an_Update_or_Installation_with_p2]
But the same page says "Unfortunately, because of p2 design flaws, revert usually doesn't work when you need it."
WHAT!?

* How do I make a Mylyn task repository connector?
The official documentation[fn::https://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/Integrator_Reference#Tasks_API] is somewhat outdated.

Does the 2009 Mylyn connector crash course[fn::http://mirror.rise.ph/eclipse//mylyn/docs/2009-03-mylyn-connector-crash-course-talk.pdf] help?

<2019-06-23>
The last news was from 2011.[fn::https://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/]
Is Mylyn dead?
Did it ever catch on?

<2019-06-22>
Mylyn has hardly any new developments?
The Git commits are rather few?

<2019-06-22>
Editing the Wiki requires review.
But there does not seem to be any reviewer.
I've been waiting for two days and there does not seem to be any approval.
Perhaps I should try opening a Bugzilla issue to ask for a Wiki edit review?

It seems that back in 2008--2013 they tried to force-fed Mylyn to developers and it backfired.

  - connectorCore: the qualified name of your subclass of AbstractRepositoryConnector
  - connectorUi: the qualified name of your subclass of AbstractRepositoryConnectorUi
* How do we get paid to develop Eclipse?
One way is to be an employee of an Eclipse Foundation member.

Can we get paid developing Eclipse?[fn::https://www.eclipse.org/contribute/dev_program.php]

no individual bug bounties, too much administrative overhead[fn::https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=309536]

"This was the purpose of FEEP and it wasn't so successful.
It added a lot of work on the Foundation bucket and was unfair since effort was focused on the IDE while the community is about much more"
