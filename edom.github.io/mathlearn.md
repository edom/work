- Setting the attitude
    - "Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them."
    John von Neumann (1903--1957) ([source](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann))
    - Mathematics is English and some rules (or whatever your language is).
    People who can understand English can get used to mathematics (with effort).
    - Mathematics is a tower of concepts.
    - Mathematics is a chain of concepts.
    - Mathematics is a tree of concepts.
- Definitions
    - *Definitions* are important.
    Your first reaction when you encounter an unknown word should be "What's its definition?"
    For example, a *group* is a set and a binary operation satisfying the group axioms.
    If you're new, your questions should be "What is a set?",
    "What is a binary operation?",
    and "What are the group axioms?",
    and then you should search them on the Internet.
    (Don't do it right now; it's just an example.)
    - Read the definition.
    Try to use the definition.
    Find some examples.
    You will forget.
    It's OK.
    Read them again later after you forgot.
    It takes several times of forgetting to get used to it,
    and eventually you'll get a feel of it.
    You _must_ expect to forget, because forgetting is part of learning.
    - Mathematicians invent new words to do more with less words.
    It's more efficient to say "\\(G\\) is a group"
    than write the group axioms in full every time a group needs to be declared.
- Notation
    - A *mathematical notation*, like the Latin alphabet,
    is a way of writing English (or whatever your language is).
    When you read "math",
    you are really reading the same language
    that you speak everyday.
    - When you encounter symbols in a sentence,
    think about how they should read in English
    to make the whole sentence grammatically correct.
    - Mathematical notations also have slangs and inconsistencies, just like English.
    We're human after all.
    - An _equation_ \\(A=B\\) means you can change
    every \\(A\\) with \\(B\\), and every \\(B\\) with \\(A\\),
    everywhere you find them, as long as the context is still the same.
    - **Don't hate the notation.**
    Used properly, it saves your time and others' time.
    - **Note:** Please memorize the 48 symbols in the [Greek alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet#Letters)
    (24 capital letters and 24 small letters).
