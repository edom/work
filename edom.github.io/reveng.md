- I want to reverse-engineer a Java 6 stock trading application.
    - The app's license agreement doesn't mention anything about reverse engineering.
- Obstacles:
    - It's obfuscated.
        - It outsmarts IntelliJ IDEA's decompiler.
    - It makes its own ClassLoader.
    - The network traffic is probably encrypted.
- The plan:
    - Find some information about how to debug Java bytecode.
        - Decision: Write a Java program that uses the JDI (Java Debug Interface).
        - References we will often use
            - [Java 8 JDI javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jdk/api/jpda/jdi/index.html)
        - Details:
            - Things that come with JDK 7:
                - [JPDA (Java Platform Debug Architecture)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/index.html)
                    - [JPDA examples that come with JDK](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/examples.html)
                        - [javadt](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/javadt.html) GUI tool
                        - [jdb](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/jdb.html) command-line tool
                        - [trace](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/trace.html)
                    - JPDA = JVMTI + JDWP + JDI
                        - JVMTI = Java Virtual Machine Tool Interface
                        - JDWP = Java Debug Wire Protocol
                        - JDI = Java Debug Interface
                            - "We recommend the JDI layer for all debugger development." ([source](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jpda/architecture.html#jdi))
                            - This enables us to write programs that debug programs.
            - Sample code
                - There doesn't seem to be any official tutorials.
                - [dzone.com: Generating a minable event stream with JDI](https://dzone.com/articles/generating-minable-event)

                - [JDK 7 jdb source code](https://github.com/openjdk-mirror/jdk7u-jdk/blob/master/src/share/classes/com/sun/tools/example/debug/tty/TTY.java).
    - Use JDB to debug the program.
        - Or perhaps Eclipse? [crowdstrike.com: Native Java Bytecode Debugging without Source Code](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/native-java-bytecode-debugging-without-source-code/)
    - Find out where to focus.
        - Map network-related call graph.
            - Put a breakpoint at Socket.getOutputStream.
            - It uses netty and thread pools, encumbering the recovery of the interesting stack frames.
            - It uses a serialization library `msgpack`. Perhaps put breakpoints there?
    - Write a program to dump the call graph of every call to netty class from non-netty class.
- Woes
    - There is no `chdir` in Java standard library, and it seems that there will never be.
    See [WONTFIX: JDK-4045688: "Add chdir or equivalent notion of changing working directory"](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-4045688).
    - Method entry event is abysmally slow.

    - Breakpointing an abstract method throws a NullPointerException.
- Do I have to do this time-consuming stuff? What are the alternatives?
    - I can buy data.
    - I can ask the company to provide some documentation about their protocols.
        - Whom should I talk to?
            - I can ask my sales representative whether he knows the people who made or is maintaining the application.
            - Someone in a local Java User Group might know something.

                    - The mailing list has devolved into a job board.
                - Is there a chat? IRC?

    - I can try to convince the company to open-source this platform.
        - Somewhat unlikely in this country that is behind the US by 10 years or perhaps even more.
    - I can switch to the company's other product that is a web app that uses websockets.
        - Which one is easier to reverse-engineer?
    - These are possible, but I would rather not do these:
        - Get a job in a securities company, and then get the required information.
- The plan:
    - Try existing deobfuscators, supercompilers, disassemblers, debuggers, and other tools.
- should try?
    - "All-in-one Java reverse engineering tool" https://github.com/helios-decompiler/standalone-app
- Optimization is a partial inverse of obfuscation.
- Optimizer can help deobfuscate unnecessary instructions, but not renamings.
- Statistical renaming can help deobfuscate names.

- Can we reverse-engineer by supercompilation or partial evaluation?
