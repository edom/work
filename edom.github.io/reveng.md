- In reverse engineering, tools are very important.

- Optimization is a partial inverse of obfuscation.
- Optimizer can help deobfuscate unnecessary instructions, but not renamings.
- Statistical renaming can help deobfuscate names.

- Ambiguous title: The phrase "Reverse-engineering software" can mean two things:
    - software that helps people do reverse-engineering
    - the act of reverse-engineering a computer program (that is, software)
