- Java application
    - I want to reverse-engineer a Java 6 stock trading application.
    - Obstacles:
        - It's obfuscated.
        - It makes its own ClassLoader.
    - Do I have to do this time-consuming stuff? What are the alternatives?
        - I can buy data.
        - I can ask the company to provide some documentation about their protocols.
            - Whom should I talk to?
                - I can ask my sales representative whether he knows the people who made or is maintaining the application.
                - Someone in a local Java User Group might know something.

                        - The mailing list has devolved into a job board.
                    - Is there a chat? IRC?

        - I can try to convince the company to open-source this platform.
            - Somewhat unlikely in this country that is behind the US by 10 years or perhaps even more.
        - I can switch to the company's other product that is a web app that uses websockets.
            - Which one is easier to reverse-engineer?
        - These are possible, but I would rather not do these:
            - Get a job in a securities company, and then get the required information.
    - The plan:
        - Try existing deobfuscators, supercompilers, disassemblers, debuggers, and other tools.
    - should try?

    - Optimization is a partial inverse of obfuscation.
    - Optimizer can help deobfuscate unnecessary instructions, but not renamings.
    - Statistical renaming can help deobfuscate names.

    - Can we reverse-engineer by supercompilation or partial evaluation?
    - search keywords to try
        - java bytecode optimizer
        - java deobfuscator
        - metacompilation, supercompilation, partial evaluation, program specialization, etc. https://everipedia.org/wiki/Metacompilation/
