- Linguistics

  - How do we use language?

    - We assume:

      - Every adjective is fuzzy.
      - Truth is a continuum.

- Corruptors and their offsprings have so much money that they don't know what to do with it.

  - Ubuntu crashed without log.

    - Screen turned off suddenly.
    - Keyboard forze.
    - Power button didn't respond even after 4 seconds.
    - The problem turned out to be shitty graphics card connection.

      - Hardware problem, not Ubuntu problem.
      - Probably dust or oxidized connectors.

        - It would be nice if graphics card could be hotswapped though.

          - But do we want to touch a running graphics card?

    - The fix: unplug and plug the card several times.

- Economics vs finance

  - Economics is about value?
  - Finance is about money?

- How do I find people who care about what I care?
- How do I find people with interests similar to mine?
- How to make money

  - Make hard things easy.

- Should we use holidays to form strategic alliances?
- To form quality relationship, socialize with one person at a time?
- There are only two way of getting rich:

  - create value (make others better)
  - extract value (steal from others, either legally or illegally)

- What is it?

  - a battle between many oppressed academics and some questionable publishing companies

- Who are the heros?

  - Aaron Swartz, who is a hero to the researchers in poor countries, and a criminal to the prosecutors
  - Timothy Gowers, who began a boycott against Elsevier
  - and other tens of thousands of academics who care, probably more
  - I don't know. There have to be other people. They don't work alone.

- Who are the villains?

  - mainly Elsevier, because of two reasons:

    - It's the biggest academic publisher.
    - It does [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier#Criticism_and_controversies][lots of questionable things]].
    - [[https://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2016/12/12/why-i-still-wont-review-for-or-publish-with-elsevier-and-think-you-shouldnt-either/][Tal Yarkoni's comprehensive argument against Elsevier]]

  - and some other predatory publishers

- What are the problems?

  - Price gouging, done rationally by a profit-seeking monopoly.
    See also the list of questionable things in the link above.

- What is the outcome of the battle?

  - How much has it impacted Elsevier's bottom line?
  - How much has it saved universities?
  - I don't know.
  - It seems that more new papers published open-access. But what about old papers? We need them too.

    - h-index, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index#Calculation

  - Are those metrics good? Do they create perverse incentive? Are people gaming the system?

    - I know someone who coauthors more papers than everyone in my university /combined/.

      - Is it possible to coauthor that many papers?
      - Is he efficient?
      - Is he cheating?

        - Perhaps he should be thanked, but he is not an author?

          - What is an author?

            - If you suggest an idea, but don't write the paper, are you an author?

/Attach reputation to reviewers, not journals./
To humans, not institutions.
What is important is not where an article is published,
but /who reviews the article/.
There are no important journals.
There are only important reviewers.

Alternatively, /make the reviewers own the journals/.
Profit-seeking is not evil on its own.
Neither is monopoly.
But together they screw buyers.

Incentivize academics to publish openly on the Internet instead on closed journals.

Make a website for peer-reviewing articles.

** Questions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: questions
   :END:

- How to research?

  - Ask research questions, answer them, and collect them into living documents.
  - Write.

    - How should we write?

      - Slides, Simon Peyton-Jones, [[https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/icfp-plmw15/slides/peyton-jones.pdf]["How to write a great research paper: seven simple suggestions"]].
        There is [[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/][a copy on Microsoft]].

    - What writing medium should we use?

      - Researchers should collaborate writing living documents instead of writing isolated papers.
        We need something like Wikipedia but for research.
        We need a goal-oriented/task-oriented Wikipedia.
        Wikiversity might be close to that.

  - Finding recent publications using academic search engines

    - I tested these using these queries: "partial evaluation", "optimal lambda"

      - [[https://scholar.google.com/][Google scholar]]
      - [[https://academic.microsoft.com/][Microsoft academic]]
      - [[https://www.base-search.net/][Bielefeld academic search engine]] boosts open-access documents.

    - aggregators

      - https://www.llrx.com/2017/01/academic-and-scholar-search-engines-and-sources-2017/

        - Different fields have different search engines.
          Why?
          What is the difference between biology literature study, computer science literature study, and physics literature study?

    - Are there academic metasearch engines / search aggregators?

- Reading academic publications

  - The input is the publication and some effort.
  - What is the output?
  - What is the best way of reading?

    - An attempt to answer that

      - Begin with a goal.
      - Every time you read a sentence, compare it to your goal.

        - If the sentence helps you reach your goal, process the sentence.
        - Otherwise, skip it.

  - A publication can be thought as a set of first-order logic statements.
  - What is knowledge?

    - A piece of knowledge is a sentence: a first-order logic statement with no free variables.

- In order to do something new, you must make sure that nobody else has done it.
  In 2018, there are 7 billion people.
- Which country values science the most?
  Where is scientist most demanded?

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD_Better_Life_Index][OECD better life index]]

- What is the best place to do research?

  - Find the leading researcher, and go there?

- What is meta-research?

  - Meta-research is research about research.
    See also [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-research][Wikipedia: Meta-research]].

- How should I structure my research?

  - Structure your research as a hierarchy of questions and answers.
    Every question may spawn child questions and answers.
    I call this format the HQA (Hierarchical Questions and Answers) or QAT (Question-Answer Tree).

    - We should group paragraphs into trees.

      - Every child explains, augments, supports, or elaborates its parent.
      - We have been grouping sentences into paragraphs.

  - Why do we need questions or problems?

    - Questions drive research.

- How do we onboard newcomers faster?

  - Write /living documents/ that summarize papers and provide directions.
    Let them improve it.
    Living documents are perfect for expository works.

    - Every research paper is a "delta" of knowledge, a "nugget", a "diff".
      We need living documents that are the sum of those deltas.
    - A possible problem: who are the authors of a collaborative living document?

- What computer document format should I publish my research in?

  - Stick to standard Web technology.
    Write your content in Markdown.
    Use MathJax if you need to typeset math on the Web.
    Let a program convert it to HTML.
    Use CSS to style your document.
  - Why should I stick to those?

    - For the reader, reading HTML pages has less friction than reading a PDF document.

  - Why should I not follow your advice?

    - Your institution probably incentivizes you to publish on famous journals, not on the Internet.
      This incentive scheme has to change for better science.
      Unfortunately you are not in the position to change it.
      It's frustrating.

- How do we use journals?

  - What are the journal article types?
    What kinds of articles do journals publish?

    - [[http://www.editage.com/insights/6-article-types-that-journals-publish-a-guide-for-early-career-researchers][Editage's six journal article types]]: original research; review article; clinical case study; clinical trial; perspective, opinion, and commentary; book review
    - There are also letters, monographs, surveys, and retractions.

- How should we organize information?

  - It depends on how the information is going to be retrieved.
  - [[http://thevisualcommunicationguy.com/2013/07/20/the-five-and-only-five-ways-to-orgaize-information/][The only five ways to organize information]]:

A person has /narrow/ interests,

I think, today, in a research group,
there has to be someone dedicated to finding resources (papers, books)
that might be related to the group's research,
because this job is huge,
given today's flood of information.

Given no further information,
we should prefer newer resources to older resources.

Given no further information,
we should put more trust on people
who have spend more time researching the topic.

- How do we find papers?

** Academics is broken. Science is broken. Research is broken.
- https://www.statnews.com/2018/10/29/alzheimers-research-outsider-bucked-prevailing-theory/
  - Alzheimer research went slowly.
    30 years and still no cure.
    Because grants are decided by narrow-minded old high guards.
    Perverse incentives.
    Too narrow.
    Too incremental.
    Too risk averse.
    Too tribal.
    Groupthink.
    Science has become a religious monoculture.
    - Science requires diverse thoughts in order to progress.
- Theoretical physics is also broken.
  It's hard to get a grant if you don't do string theory.
  See Lee Smolin's commentary.

  - What is the difference between variable and parameter?
  - How many parameters do we need to model a system?
  - Discrete Newtonian kinematical model
    - A /system at time \( t \)/ is a set of particles ( { 1, \ldots, n } ).
      - Time is a real number: \( t \in \Real \).
      - The number of particle is constant \( n \in \Nat \).
      - For each particle \( k \):
        - It has /position/ \( x_k \in \Real^3 \).
        - Simplifying assumptions
          - particle
            - It is a point.
              - It doesn't occupy any space.
            - Its mass is not modeled.
          - Time is global and absolute (the same everywhere).
  - Discrete Newtonian dynamical model (N-body problem) extends discrete Newtonian kinematical model.
    - A /system at time \( t \)/ is all that above, plus:
      - For each particle \( k \):
        - It has /mass/ \( m_k \in \Real \).
        - It has /resultant force/ \( F_k \) acting on it.
        - Simplifying assumptions about the particle
          - It is rigid.
            - It doesn't deform.
            - It doesn't break.
          - Its mass is constant.
          - It don't interact with other particles.
            - Particles don't merge or collide.
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics][WP:Continuum mechanics]]
  - Skippable philosophical issues?
    - Does "the same particle at different times" make sense?
      - What is "same"?

** Common company wiki fundamental problem
- Employees have no reason to read the wiki.
- It doesn't help them do their jobs.
  - Why should they read it then?
** Library problems
  - In 2018, a lot of human knowledge is still in libraries and not available on the Internet.
    Digital typesetting was invented relatively recently.
    Papers should be scanned and OCR-ed.
    AI can help.
  - Why are there different libraries?
    There should be only one library in the world.
    All library should be the same.
    All library should have the same content.

*** Evolutionary ethics

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_morality
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_ethics
- Evolutionary ethics
    - Morality is shaped by evolution.
    - We have difficulties defining what is "good", but there are things that we agree are good.
    - Morality is defined by the majority opinion.
    - Humans evolved morality because morality promotes survival.
        - Nature selects moral behavior. There is evolutionary pressure for moral behavior.
            - Sharing foods promotes survival.
            - Sharing knowledge promotes survival.
            - Cooperation promotes survival.
            - Marriage promotes survival?
            - Monogamy promotes survival?
    - The morality of a species is whatever evolved behavior that promotes its survival.

** Refuting bullshit

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit#Bullshit_asymmetry_principle][WP:Bullshit asymmetry principle]]
  - "The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it."
  - Does that mean it's easier to fight a bullshit with another bullshit?
    - Why don't we fight bullshit with bullshit?
    - Why don't we fight false news with false news?
    - Why don't we fight hoaxes with hoaxes?
    - Why don't we fight propagandas with propagandas?
    - If we fight lies with lies, everybody loses?

** Teaching and learning
  - How to teach history (or anything)
    - Don't memorize things that you can look up on the Internet.
    - Focus on stories, insights, reasons, motivations.
    - Empathize with the subjects.
      Why do they go to war?
  - Learning languages, both human languages and programming languages
    - One learns a language by example sentences.
      One learns a programming language by example programs/snippets.
      - One does not learn a language by memorizing the syntax.
      - One does not learn a language by memorizing the language reference document.

- [[https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems][Forget About Setting Goals. Focus on This Instead.]]: focus on systems/processes instead of goals.

** How to get research grants?
- What are the laws and rules?
- Who makes the decisions?
- How do you improve your chances?
** What does an assistant professor do?
According to https://recruit.ucsc.edu/apply/JPF00651:
- develop a research program
- advise graduate students in their research area
- obtain external funding
- develop and teach courses within the undergraduate and graduate curriculum
- perform university, public, and professional service

That's a lot for one person to do.
