- How does employment and slavery compare?
    - Slavery is the ownership of humans.
    - Employment is the rental of humans.
    - How has slavery changed?
        - Humans used to buy humans. Now humans rent other humans.
            - 2018: we can even rent a friend.
        - [r/LateStageCapitalism: In slavery, you are bought--in capitalism, you are rented](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/68fkek/in_slavery_you_are_boughtin_capitalism_you_are/)
        - "Hiring" *is* "renting".
            - You rent a car. The contract includes an insurance. You use the car for anything; just don't break it.
            - You hire an employee. The contract includes an insurance. You use the employee for anything; just don't break it.

    - Companies must extract value to survive.
        - A profitable company must extract more value
        from its employees than it pays its employees.
            - People create value. People in a company create value. Human labor creates value.
            Companies aren't human. Companies can't work. It's the employees who work.
            - But if the employees weren't in the company, they might create less value.
            The company might be a place where the employees can create more value for society.
