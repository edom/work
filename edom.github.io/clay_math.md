# Solving the Clay millennium prize problems

- What is the progress?
    - In 2017, [Norbert Blum](http://theory.cs.uni-bonn.de/blum/blum.var) (Prof. Dr. in CS at Bonn, Germany)
    proposed a proof, found out that it failed, and explained why it failed.
    See also the news on [theregister.co.uk](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/08/31/pnp_proof_fails_yet_again/)
    and the discussion on [CSSE 38803](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/38803/is-norbert-blums-2017-proof-that-p-ne-np-correct).
    - [G.J. Woeginger's P-vs-NP page](https://www.win.tue.nl/~gwoegi/P-versus-NP.htm)
    says that the most recent attempt is in 2016. It lists a hundred of failed attempts.
    - From 2015: [/r/askscience: Has there been any progress on the seven millennium [math] prize problems?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2shpn7/has_there_been_any_progress_on_the_seven/)
    - From 2014: [Quora: Has there been any progress on the other millennium prize problems?](https://www.quora.com/Has-there-been-any-progress-on-the-other-Millennium-Prize-Problems)
    - From 2009: [Lance Fortnow's CACM 2009 review article "The Status of the P Versus NP Problem"](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/9/38904-the-status-of-the-p-versus-np-problem/fulltext)
- What are the Clay Millenium Prize Problems?
The Clay Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, Massachusetts (CMI),
offers one million US dollars for each solution of [the seven problems](http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems),
of which these are unsolved:
    - Riemann hypothesis
    - Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture
    - Hodge conjecture
    [official problem description](http://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/hodge.pdf)
    - P versus NP problem, of computational complexity theory
        - [arxiv cs.CC - Computational Complexity](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CC/recent)
        - [arxiv cs.LO - Logic in Computer Science](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LO/recent)
    - Navier--Stokes existence and smoothness
    - Yang--Mills and mass gap
