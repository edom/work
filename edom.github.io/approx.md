We are interested in approximation theory because we want to justify how neural networks work.

We should begin by skimming the 1998 book "A Short Course on Approximation Theory" by N. L. Carothers ([pdf](http://fourier.math.uoc.gr/~mk/approx1011/carothers.pdf)).
Then we should skim the 2017 lecture notes "Lectures on multivariate polynomial approximation" ([pdf](http://www.math.unipd.it/~demarchi/MultInterp/LectureNotesMI.pdf)).

The phrase "x *approximates* y" means "x is *close* to y", which implies distance, which implies metric space.

How close is the approximation?
Suppose that the function \\( g \\) approximates the function \\( f \\) in interval \\( I \\).
Then:

- The "approximation error at \\( x \\)" is \\( g(x) - f(x) \\).
- The "maximum absolute error" is \\( \max_{x \in I} \abs{g(x) - f(x)} \\).

How do we measure the distance between two \\( \Real \to \Real \\) functions \\( f \\) and \\( g \\)?
There are several ways.
Which should we use?

- The maximum norm, in interval \\( I \\) is \\( \max_{x \in I} \abs{f(x) - g(x)} \\).
This norm is also called uniform norm, supremum norm, Chebyshev norm, infinity norm, norm-infinity, \\( L_\infty \\)-norm.
Why is it called "uniform"?
[WP:Uniform norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_norm).
- What is this norm called? \\( \int_{x \in I} [f(x)-g(x)]^2 ~ dx \\).

        The resulting interpolation polynomial minimizes the problem of Runge's phenomenon and provides an approximation that is close to the polynomial of best approximation to a continuous function under the maximum norm."

- Less relevant overview
    - Why do we approximate?
        - Because it is practically inevitable.
            - Fundamental reason: Because computers are finite.
            - Practical reason: Trade-off between computation time and precision.
                - The more error we can afford, the faster we can run.
