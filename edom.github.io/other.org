  - What is the difference between variable and parameter?
  - How many parameters do we need to model a system?
  - Discrete Newtonian kinematical model
    - A /system at time \( t \)/ is a set of particles ( { 1, \ldots, n } ).
      - Time is a real number: \( t \in \Real \).
      - The number of particle is constant \( n \in \Nat \).
      - For each particle \( k \):
        - It has /position/ \( x_k \in \Real^3 \).
        - Simplifying assumptions
          - particle
            - It is a point.
              - It doesn't occupy any space.
            - Its mass is not modeled.
          - Time is global and absolute (the same everywhere).
  - Discrete Newtonian dynamical model (N-body problem) extends discrete Newtonian kinematical model.
    - A /system at time \( t \)/ is all that above, plus:
      - For each particle \( k \):
        - It has /mass/ \( m_k \in \Real \).
        - It has /resultant force/ \( F_k \) acting on it.
        - Simplifying assumptions about the particle
          - It is rigid.
            - It doesn't deform.
            - It doesn't break.
          - Its mass is constant.
          - It don't interact with other particles.
            - Particles don't merge or collide.

* Common company wiki fundamental problem
- Employees have no reason to read the wiki.
- It doesn't help them do their jobs.
  - Why should they read it then?
* Library problems
  - In 2018, a lot of human knowledge is still in libraries and not available on the Internet.
    Digital typesetting was invented relatively recently.
    Papers should be scanned and OCR-ed.
    AI can help.
  - Why are there different libraries?
    There should be only one library in the world.
    All library should be the same.
    All library should have the same content.
* <2018-08-29> IQ and jobs
  Although I'm happy to be proven wrong,
  I believe that a minimum IQ of 120 is necessary but not sufficient for software engineering (cooperativeness is also required).
  It seems IQ tests are inaccurate for high IQs above 130.

    - The OP doesn't sound like his IQ is 89.
  - Higher IQ means faster learning, and that's all.
  - To each according to their ability.
    Society needs low IQ people.
    Some jobs fit low IQ people.
    These jobs are equally honorable as high IQ jobs are.
    Low IQ isn't an insult.

How to measure member contribution?
This is hard, if even possible at all.
Thus it's a bad idea to distribute profit according to member contribution.
An alternative way to distribute is
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs][WP:From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]],
but it only works if there is abundance.

* Should we assume scarcity or abundance?
- Which assumption is better?
  - Assumption of scarcity: Human always wants more than what exists. There is never enough resources for everybody.
  - Assumption of abundance: There is a point where humans are satisfied. There are enough resources for everybody.

I think the assumption of abundance is saner.
But unfortunately it seems to lead to communism.

Software engineers share as much as possible to avoid repeating work.

Most software engineers use the same operating system.
Every country has its own constitution.
This is an insane amount of duplication.

There should be a "software library" for laws.
Laws should be reusable.

In year 1000 AD who would have thought that 1000 years later we would have AI deepfakes,
human sex change (sex reassignment surgery, hormone therapy),
and what else reality-bending technologies we have.

In 2018 those technologies aren't perfect.
We can see deepfake artifacts.
We can tell apart transsexuals from their hips.
Maybe in the future those technologies will be perfected.
Maybe in the future people can be whoever they want to be.
"You are who you want to be" is getting more literal.

When that time comes, we will have more respect for philosophers.
If everything is easy to fake, then what is real, and how do we know it's real?
If everything is easy to fake, then what can be taken as proof in court?
What really exists?
If a man can easily become a woman, and a woman can easily become a man, then what does it mean to be a man/woman?
Do ID cards still make sense if you are immortal and you change your identity every 6 months?
Technology will force us to deal with ontology and epistemology.

Reality discontents humans.
We work hard to deceive our senses so that we can escape reality.
We try to make imagination real, and make reality irrelevant.
The Matrix is getting real.

* <2018-09-11> Microeconomics
An economy consists of actors.

- No economic actor has complete view of the economy.
  Every actor can only see his suppliers and consumers.
- Every actor responds only to what immediately affects it: its direct suppliers and consumers.
- Actors need time to respond to change in demand/supply.
- Some actors maintain buffers/inventories.
- Some actors get involved in futures.

Hypotheses:

- Shocks ripple through actors.
- Demand collapse may waste inventory.

Statistics can give us an accurate picture of the economy.

* Hiring, interviewing, recruiting
** We should use machine learning to hire?
** Hiring standards, what to test in work sample tests
*** IOT engineer
Must master some of hardware, software, and business.

- Software
  - C++ smart pointers
- Hardware
  - soldering skills
  - basic understanding of electric circuits
  - designing and making PCBs, including local knowledge of where to buy components and services

What the employer may expect the employee to do:

- design and make systems (hardware and software) with constrained production cost and field operation
- maintain existing programs written in C++/Java (or whatever the employer uses), including documenting software
- travel to maintain remote hardware
** What is the best predictor?
According to [[http://blog.eskill.com/best-worst-predictors/][eskill.com]]:
- past behavior
- conscientiousness (what is this? how do we test this?)
- cognitive ability

Interviews must be structured.
Unstructured interviews waste time.

[[https://resources.workable.com/blog/conduct-structured-interview][How to conduct a structured interview | Workable]]

We can test skill.

How do we test behavior?

Questions are unreliable.
Actions are reliable.

Where is the research paper?

How does Google hire?

What is the best predictor of on-the-job performance?
How do we interview to best predict on-the-job/post-interview performance?
- the reputation of recent employers (2 years?), and how long the employee worked at those employers
- past experience
- work sample test
- education/university
- IQ
- github
- tricky questions
- school grades
- what else?

Is there evidence-based hiring like evidence-based medicine?

Can we use machine learning to hire people?

** Uncertainty in hiring
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: uncertainty-in-hiring
   :END:

In hiring, if a candidate leaves good impressions (not exceptional, but decent nonetheless), but you aren't sure about him, should you just reject him?
Does "maybe" mean "no"?

** To avoid wasting time, begin with the most selective test.
Begin with the test with the highest failure ratio.
End the interview as soon as the candidates fail the test.
Respect their time and your time.
Don't force them to do what they can't do well.
Don't set them up to fail.
If you aren't going to hire them, don't waste their time.
** Recruitment pipeline
- Review the resume / curriculum vitae.
** You know your job ad is wrong when...
You know your job ad is wrong when you have to obviously reject a lot of candidates without thinking.

People don't read the job description.
People only read the job title.

To make sure that people read the job description, you can require that the applicant include a secret word that can only be found in the job ad.
Auto-reject people who don't read the job description.

** <2018-09-19> Recruiting networks are double-edged swords for employers
Example tools: Linkedin, SmartRecruiters.

You can use it to find new employees.
But your employees can also use it to find new employers.

But the overall economy stands to gain if we can fix the information asymmetry in job market.
** <2018-09-19> Sturgeon's law, originally for science fiction, also applies to job applicants
"Ninety percent of everything is crap."

Ninety percent of your applicants is crap.

Indeed it applies to /everything/.
Ninety percent of /everything/ is crap.
Software.
Companies.
Goods.

Ninety percent of /everything/ is crap: people, countries, etc.;
and we may be in that 90%.
** <2018-09-19> GitHub is trying machine learning
- I think GitHub should be like StackOverflow but for open-source codes/libraries/programs instead of questions.
  Prevent people from reinventing the wheel.
  Help people find things that already exist.
  - <2018-09-19>
    Google is doing a better job at what GitHub should be doing:
    finding existing open-source software, that does something we want, that we can reuse.
    It's a hard problem.
- [[https://githubengineering.com/towards-natural-language-semantic-code-search/][Towards Natural Language Semantic Code Search | GitHub Engineering]]
- I think StackOverflow can use machine learning to comprehend user query and recommend related questions/answers/information.
* How do we model historical data in SQL?
- Do we have to use SQL?
- Is SQL the best tool for the job?
- Does SQL do the job well enough to justify reducing maintenance costs?
- How is historical data related to audit trail?
  - Audit trail encompasses historical data.
    Audit trail is a more stringent requirement.
