- Linguistics

  - How do we use language?

    - We assume:

      - Every adjective is fuzzy.
      - Truth is a continuum.

- Corruptors and their offsprings have so much money that they don't know what to do with it.
- 2017-07-10

  - Ubuntu crashed without log.

    - Screen turned off suddenly.
    - Keyboard forze.
    - Power button didn't respond even after 4 seconds.
    - The problem turned out to be shitty graphics card connection.

      - Hardware problem, not Ubuntu problem.
      - Probably dust or oxidized connectors.

        - It would be nice if graphics card could be hotswapped though.

          - But do we want to touch a running graphics card?

    - The fix: unplug and plug the card several times.

- Economics vs finance

  - Economics is about value?
  - Finance is about money?

- How do I find people who care about what I care?
- How do I find people with interests similar to mine?
- How to make money

  - Make hard things easy.

- Should we use holidays to form strategic alliances?
- To form quality relationship, socialize with one person at a time?
- There are only two way of getting rich:

  - create value (make others better)
  - extract value (steal from others, either legally or illegally)

  - Discrete Newtonian kinematical model
    - A /system at time \( t \)/ is a set of particles ( { 1, \ldots, n } ).
      - Time is a real number: \( t \in \Real \).
      - The number of particle is constant \( n \in \Nat \).

              - It doesn't occupy any space.
            - Its mass is not modeled.
          - Time is global and absolute (the same everywhere).
  - Discrete Newtonian dynamical model (N-body problem) extends discrete Newtonian kinematical model.
    - A /system at time \( t \)/ is all that above, plus:
      - For each particle \( k \):
        - It has /mass/ \( m_k \in \Real \).
        - It has /resultant force/ \( F_k \) acting on it.
        - Simplifying assumptions about the particle
          - It is rigid.
            - It doesn't deform.
            - It doesn't break.
          - Its mass is constant.
          - It don't interact with other particles.

- Evolutionary ethics
    - Morality is shaped by evolution.
    - We have difficulties defining what is "good", but there are things that we agree are good.
    - Morality is defined by the majority opinion.
    - Humans evolved morality because morality promotes survival.
        - Nature selects moral behavior. There is evolutionary pressure for moral behavior.
            - Sharing foods promotes survival.
            - Sharing knowledge promotes survival.
            - Cooperation promotes survival.

    - The morality of a species is whatever evolved behavior that promotes its survival.
** Teaching and learning
  - How to teach history (or anything)
    - Don't memorize things that you can look up on the Internet.
    - Focus on stories, insights, reasons, motivations.
    - Empathize with the subjects.
      Why do they go to war?
  - Learning languages, both human languages and programming languages
    - One learns a language by example sentences.
      One learns a programming language by example programs/snippets.

* Getting rich
** How do we get rich?
There are only two ways to get rich: /earn/ wealth or /steal/ wealth.

Earn wealth: convince people to give you money, by selling them things that improve their lives.
Use the money to develop your wealth even more.

Or steal wealth: An investor steals a little wealth from each person who does not invest.

After you obtain enough wealth, develop it, but don't lose all of them.
** What?
- Which is more fundamental, economics or finance?
  Which is built on which?

- Why get rich?

  - Get more power.
  - Change the world.
    Bend the world to your will.
    Impose your ideals onto the world.
  - Actualize your dreams.

- The problem with opening a business is too many choices.

  - Almost all businesses make money.
  - Every obvious business idea is already taken.

  - Use credit card, not debit card.

    - Use credit card, but don't fall into debt.
      Treat credit card as means of payment, not loan.
    - Never use debit card outside trusted ATMs.
    - But what about cash withdrawals from ATMs?
      Credit cards have higher fees.

- What is money?

  - Money is a way for people to decide what is important (vote for what is important).

    - People vote with their money.

- The job of a company (a company director?) is to find what to do and find who should do it.

  - Everyone has different tendencies, strengths, weaknesses, desires, preferences, habits, upbringings, backgrounds.
  - Some people are more suited for some jobs.

    - Some jobs require high IQ; otherwise the employee will take too long to learn.
    - Some jobs require low IQ; otherwise the employee will get bored too soon.

      - Yes, low IQ can be a strength.

  - The company has goals.
  - The director breaks down the goals into jobs.
  - The director matches employees and jobs.
  - Which comes first: the job or the employee?

    - Do you formulate a job description first, and then find people to do that?
    - Do you hire people first, and then formulate jobs suitable for them?

  - A good company accomplishes more than each employee can accomplish individually.

      - The 21st century way of living is radically different.
        Different ideas of freedom.

        - In the post-Westphalian worldview, freedom means sovereignty, being autonomous, being an island.

    - Second Industrial Revolution teaches kids to be factory workers. Obedient. Unquestioning. Hardworking.

  - Corporates were invented by aristocrats to make sure peasants stay peasants?
  - [[https://bigthink.com/videos/douglas-rushkoff-on-the-internet-and-the-future-of-business][transcript]]

    - We should verify and distill these texts.
      These are some bold claims.

      - "As the peasants became wealthy the aristocracy got scared, who are these people?
        They're not going to be dependent on us any more.
        So they came up with two main financial innovations to prevent the rise of this peer to peer economy.
        The first one was the chartered monopoly, really the parent to the modern corporation.
        All the chartered monopoly was was a way to say all of you small businesses are now illegal.
        If you want to be in the shoe business you have to work for his majesty's royal shoe company.
        You want to be in the grain business you have to work for his majesty's royal grain company.
        So people who were small business people now became employees.
        Instead of selling the value they created, now they sold their time as servants, as wage laborers."
      - "The second invention they came up with was central currency.
        Not such a terrible thing in itself.
        It's great to have a long distance currency that lots of people can use and value, but the problem was they made all of the local currencies illegal.
        So the only way people could trade with each other, the candlestick maker could trade with the chicken farmer was by borrowing central currency from the treasury.
        So now you had to borrow money at interest just in order to transact.
        And that set in motion really a growth cascade.
        If you have a currency that has to be paid back with interest, in order to just make end meet you need an economy that's growing.
        You need more money next year than there was this year."
      - "So that worked well for colonial powers, as long as we could extend into Africa and South America and North America, find slaves, find new resources, we could grow.
        But what happens when you reach the end of the planet's growth as we did really at the end of World War II?"

- Work-life balance?

  - Life /is/ work.
  - Your work defines you.
    You are only as good as your contribution to the world.
    Your work defines the meaning of your life.
  - Don't confuse working with employment.

    - Work is everything that creates value.
    - Employment is just a kind of work.

  - Don't confuse being busy and working.

    - Work should create value.
    - You can feel busy while not producing anything.
    - Work has goals. Being busy doesn't have goals.

  - People don't care about processes.
    They only care about results.
  - If you are not working in all your waking hours, then it's not the work you want.
  - If I could work in my sleep, I would!

- Transport is waste.
  Hence travel is waste.
- Why can't people stay at home on holidays?

  - If you don't like staying at home on holidays, that means something is wrong with your home.
    Fix it.
    Make it the best place on Earth.
    Face reality.
    Don't escape.

- Communism

  - The USSR was beyond communism; it was Stalinism.
  - Stalinism failed because it overcentralizes power.

    - Power corrupts.
    - Oppression isn't a good long-term strategy.
    - People are like gas.

      - Increasing pressure (oppression, stress, overcrowding) increases temperature (collisions, friction, conflicts, clashes).

  - People would still work even if they couldn't get rich.

    - People work to give their life meaning, not to get rich.

      - Getting rich is a side-effect.

    - Would they work better if they could get rich?

- If you buy land and let it idle, only to sell it higher in the future, then you're /seeking rent/.

  - You are not creating any value.
    You burden society.
    You get rich by burdening others, making them poorer.
    The world is better without you.
    You contribute to city sprawl, which causes winding roads, more fuel consumption, more traffic, more pollution, and more heat.
    You should be heavily taxed for the huge negative externality you cause.

- Is all speculation rent-seeking?
** Capitalism
- What is capitalism?

  - Capitalism is:

    1. the /private ownership/ of means of production,
    2. the operation of such means /for profit/.

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism][WP: Capitalism]].

- How is it good?

  - Capitalism enables selfish people to better everyone else.
  - Voluntary exchange betters everyone.

    - People don't agree to a deal they think bad for them.

- How is it bad?

  - Wealth gap? Social gap?
  - Capitalism places capital above labor?
  - Short-term profit-seeking and rent-seeking destroys environment and humanity?

- How can it be improved?

  - Regulation

    - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOaJe68C-bU][How to Improve Capitalism]]

  - Capitalism can be environmentally friendly if the polluters pay the environmental costs.

    - 2018: other people are still paying the cost. (Negative externality)

- How does employment and slavery compare?

  - Slavery is the ownership of humans.
  - Employment is the rental of humans.
  - How has slavery changed?

    - Humans used to buy humans. Now humans rent other humans.

    - "Hiring" /is/ "renting".

      - You rent a car. The contract includes an insurance. You use the car for anything; just don't break it.
      - You hire an employee. The contract includes an insurance. You use the employee for anything; just don't break it.

    - [[http://www.differencebetween.net/business/difference-between-labor-and-human-capital/][differencebetween.net: labor and human capital]]

- Ramble

  - Companies must extract value to survive.

    - A profitable company must extract more value
      from its employees than it pays its employees.

      - People create value. People in a company create value. Human labor creates value.
        Companies aren't human. Companies can't work. It's the employees who work.
      - But if the employees weren't in the company, they might create less value.
        The company might be a place where the employees can create more value for society.

- Capital is everything that is not labor?
- Capitalism is capital above labor? Communism is labor above capital?

  - How do we persuade/encourage people to buy a stock?
    How do you market a stock?

    - This is gray area.
      Is it even legal?

  - How do we prevent sellers from selling?

- Hypothesis: Some companies' financial statements predict economic/financial crises.

  - How are economic crises even possible if there is enough money for everybody?

    - Uneven distribution of money?
    - Hypothesis: The solution to an economic crisis is a forced redistribution of money, an economic reboot/restart, however unpleasant.

      - In an economic crisis, tax the wealthy and pay the poor.
      - I think that is an optimal solution (if not the only solution), but that is politically incorrect, so we'll never see that.

    - If ignored, economic crisis will escalate to sociopolitical crisis.

- Banks lend money with interest.
  Thus, paying back the loans reduce circulating money.

- ontology

  - wealth

    - /Wealth/ is the sum of satisfied wants.

  - price, pay, ownership, exchange, transaction

    - To /own/ something is to have exclusive access to that thing.
    - /Exchange/ and /transaction/ are synonyms.
    - An /exchange/ is an agreement

      - between two parties A and B where

        - A gives X to B,
        - B gives Y to A.

    - If X is money and Y is not money, then:

      - X is the price.

        - /Price/ is the amount agreed for exchange.
        - /Price/ is something sacrificed to get something else.

      - A is the buyer.
      - B is the seller.
      - The buyer /pays/ the price to the seller.

  - negotiation, price-taker, price-maker

    - Negotiating parties often have asymmetrical bargaining power.
    - The price-taker is the weaker one.
    - The price-maker is the stronger one.

  - money and currency

    - Money has /currency/ and /amount/ (/magnitude/).
    - Money can be /exchanged/ with many other things.

  - debt, interest, and price

    - The price of debt is the /interest/
      (the amount of money that will be exchanged for obtaining the loan now).

      - An X market is a market where X is traded.

        - A money market is a market where money is traded.

          - How do you buy money with money?

- Assumptions

  - Every human:

    - Has wants.
    - Has priorities? Utility function?

      - Non-constructive? It exists, but we don't know what it is?

    - Acts to satisfy those wants.

- Counterexamples? Where the theory breaks down?

  - Thiefs want something more than freedom?

    - But both of the stolen thing and the freedom will be taken away?

  - Smokers and junk food eaters don't want health?

    - Everybody wants health?

      - But doesn't behave consistent with wants?

        - Cognitive dissonance?

          - Want health later or health now?
          - Addiction?

            - Physical changes to the brain?

- Fundamentals of economics

  - Everybody wants something.
  - How do we satisfy more people using less resources?

- Higher-order belief

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest][WP:Keynesian beauty contest]]
  - Examples of higher-order beliefs:

    - People believe that money is valuable because they believe
      that others also believe that money is valuable.

- How do we give more than we take?

  - How do we produce more than we consume?

- Land > Labor > Capital

  - The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production][factors of production]]
    in classical economics are:

    - land (all other things that exist in nature),
    - labor (human),
    - capital (tools).

  - Land creates labor.
  - Labor creates capital.
  - If capital is destroyed, labor can rebuild it.
  - If labor is destroyed, capital cannot rebuild it.
  - Labor without capital is inefficient.
  - Capital without labor is /nothing/.
  - However, without land, nothing would exist at all.
  - Therefore, land is more important than labor, and labor is more important than capital,

    - but it seems here that capital is revered, labor is disdained, and land is forgotten.

  - Money is not capital, but it can be used to buy capital, but this quote is related:
    > When the last tree is cut, the last fish is caught, and the last river is polluted;
    > when to breathe the air is sickening, you will realize, too late,

- Tax

  - Tax enables government to redistribute money (and therefore some wealth).
  - Tax enables government to discourage the consumption of certain goods.
  - Taxation is legalized robbery.

    - The government forcibly takes some of the people's money.
    - The people doesn't get to decide what the tax money is used for.

      - The government is assumed to use that money for the people's good.

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics][WP:Trickle-down economics]]

  - How does one arrive at this? How does one think? What is the argument?

- If the total amount of money is constant,

  is to make someone else has less money.

    - "Mercantilists viewed the economic system as a zero-sum game, in which any gain by one party required a loss by another.[16]"

- Questions I haven't been able to answer

  - If everybody needs to buy food, then why aren't farmers the richest people on Earth?

    - What if the farmers don't spend?

      - Will money collect at the farmers?
      - Will they be the richest people on Earth?

- Money circulation

  - Circulating money amount should be proportional to amount of goods/services exchanged?
  - The amount of money in circulation can be reduced by tax or destruction.
  - Why do governments sell bonds?

    - To reduce the amount of money in circulation now?

      - At the cost of increasing a bigger amount of money circulating in the future?

  - Money moves faster in certain areas?
  - How does the government increases the amount of money in circulation?

    - How I think it might be done:

      - Create new money.
      - Spend that money by buying things from a few elites,

        - with the hope that the elites will quickly spend that money to the lesser elites.

          - Thus that money will circulate to more people.

            - But isn't this trickle-down economics?

    - But does it even do this? Isn't it the banks?

  - What is the effect of people's borrowing from banks?

    - Increase circulating money now (boom part of boom-bust cycle).
    - Reduce /more/ circulating money later (bust part of boom-bust cycle, when the loan is paid back with interest).

      - Principal plus interest (money retired) is greater than principal (money created),
        so the net effect of lending money now
        is a delayed reduction of a greater amount of money in circulation.

        - Where does the money to pay the interest come from?

          - If left alone, eventually the money collects at the banks?

            - But banks have expenses too.

              - Banks need to pay taxes, pay their utility bills,
                pay their staffs.

            - But shouldn't the money collect at the farmers?

  - The ideal inflation rate is zero?

** Defining investing, trading, gambling, betting, wagering, insurance
*** Defining gambling
We say that a person /gambles/ iff he bets on an outcome that he doesn't know how to control at all.

Thus, there are two necessary conditions for something to be a gamble:
- There exists a bet.
- There does not exist control.

Other definitions of gambling:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling
- US legal definition https://definitions.uslegal.com/g/gambling/
*** How do we know something is not gambling?
**** If it's possible to be skillful, then it's not gambling.
*** What
- Investing
- Trading
- Betting
- Random/uncontrollable
- Individual outcome is unpredictable

Can two unskilled people playing chess control the outcome?

Wager and bet are synonyms.

The gambler doesn't have /any/ control over the outcome of a gamble.
How do we know if someone has some control? The ability to affect outcome. By how much? By physical explanation?
Too hard to predict?

The gamblers are gambling, but the casino isn't.
The casino can control the outcome.

Although the individual outcomes are unpredictable, the trend is predictable.

Insurance is reverse gambling, which is also gambling.
It is absurd to buy something that you avoid using.

- "What makes gambling wrong but insurance right?" https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38905963
- https://seekingalpha.com/article/4080260-insurance-gambling-seriously
  - "Insurance is a very specific type of gambling."
  - "Two parties agree on the consideration (by calling that wager a premium instead),
    the type of chance (by using expectations of when the insured might die, for example),
    and a prize (by referring to the winnings as a death benefit)."

Can you insure yourself against loss at the casino?

Is professional poker gambling?
If a skilled player can consistently beat an unskilled player, than the skilled player can control the outcome, and thus the skilled player is not gambling.

If skill (improvement) is possible, then it isn't gambling.

Can you be skilled in throwing dice so that you can consistently beat unskilled people?
Slot machines?
Guessing computer-generated numbers?
What is a possible physical explanation?

How do we argue that binary option is gambling?

I saw binary options marketed with fake Facebook comments.
I know those Facebook comments are fake because all of them have perfect grammar, capitalization, and punctuation.

Don't tell anyone.

** "Investing"
What Bitcoin "investing" is:
- You buy a certificate of environmental destruction from someone, probably a "miner".
- You expect a greater fool to buy that certificate from you at a higher price.
  There are millions of other people who are looking for someone else more stupid than them.

Bitcoin is massive wealth transfer from late buyers to early buyers.
All financial investing is massive "realistic-return" Ponzi scheme.
Exactly fits the definition.
Newcomers pay oldtimers.
Late buyers pay early buyers.

Bitcoin is not necessary at all. It is pure want.
Inflation target disincentivizes currency hoarding.
A deflating currency encourages currency hoarding and discourages real spending.

** Economics, price, quality
Price is not important in itself.
It is the quality-price trade-off that is important.
People don't buy shit even if it's cheap, even if you pay them to buy it.

For an increment of quality, people are willing to pay an increment of price.
But there is a "good enough" point where people are satisfied and they just look at the lowest price.

Negative price means willingness to pay to get rid of something.
Example: rotten vegetables has negative price to most people, but positive price to farmers.
** Economics?
We should measure debt-to-income ratio instead of debt-to-GDP ratio?

Consumptive debt sacrifices future for the present.

Productive debt is good.

Example of productive debt:

Suppose that you want to buy a land to farm on it. These are the scenarios:
- You work for 20 years. Then you buy the land with cash. But the land price has risen.
- You take a loan, buy the land now, and repay the loan over 10 years. In the second year, your land starts producing.

If a person takes too much consumptive debt, he goes bankrupt.

If a government takes too much consumptive debt nominated in its own currency, it can print money to repay the debt, but such printing devalues the currency.

If the US continues to take loans mindlessly, it will have to choose:
- Default (refuse to repay).
- Suffer severe inflation (rising prices), if the creditors spend the printed money.

Does the USA think it can get away by refusing to repay its debts? It will trigger a huge power shift, maybe to China. Will China sacrifice itself to clean up America's mess? Will China buy up all US debts, and use the default as a reason to start a war?

Everything comes from nature.
We are not creating or destroying anything.
We are merely transforming things.
At least as seen from physics.

The number of atoms in Earth doesn't change.
(But what about solar wind? It does change a bit?)

Urban toilet harms humans and the Earth.
- We should poo squatting, not sitting.
- Urine and feces should be composted, not flushed down the drain.
- Compost bins should replace septic tanks.

  - This corrupts Chromium profile.
  - Chromium fails to restore tabs.
    - This is the second time it fails.

** <2018-09-22> Derita naik Gojek/Gocar
Saya sempat coba Grab dan Gojek.
Saya tidak pakai Grab karena saya benci kode promo.
Akhirnya berlabuh di Gojek.

- Gojek
  - Kadang pengemudi tidak bisa membaca.
    Tiap minggu ada saja pengemudi yang tidak baca catatan, lalu nyasar.
    Sangat buang waktu.
  - Kadang dapat motor Yamaha Aerox.
    - Motor ini tidak aman; pusat massa tinggi, mengurangi kestabilan.
    - Motor ini tidak nyaman; joknya keras, suspensinya keras, menyiksa pantat.
    - Contoh motor yang enak: Honda Scoopy.
      Tampilannya emang culun, tapi jok lebar dan empuk, dan suspensi juga lembut.
      Enak buat pantat.
    - (Saya tidak punya motor.
      Saya bukan fans Yamaha ataupun Honda.
      Saya cuma benci sakit pantat.)
  - Kadang ban kempes.
    Kadang motor bocor.
    Kadang ban bocor.
  - Pernah, jam 17:00, 30 menit gak ada yang ambil.
- Gocar
  - Kadang pengemudi mengantuk, merem melek.
    Mobil ngegas ngerem.
  - Posisi suka ngaco.
    Minta jemput di S Parman, supir di Mal Pondok Indah lah (12 km), di Pejompongan lah (6 km), di Tomang lah (4 km), di sisi jalan yang salah lah (4 km).
  - Kadang di-cancel 5 kali baru dapat.
  - Kadang mobil bau rokok.
- Grabbike
  - <2018-10-05> Grab jam 17 sangat shitty.
    Driver tidak bisa dihubungi.
    Dua kali berturut-turut.
- Grabcar
  - <2018-10-25> Saya ditinggal kabur supir grabcar, padahal saya tinggal 5 langkah dari mobil, dan dia belum ada 5 menit menunggu.
- Aplikasi Gojek vs Grab:
  - Grab lebih reliable.
  - Gojek lebih hemat baterai.
- Perasaan saya.
  - Teknologi keduanya shitty, tapi teknologi Grab less shitty daripada teknologi Gojek;
    Grabcar lebih bisa mencari supir yang dekat (500 m, 1 km); Gocar seringkali dapat supir (2 km, bahkan pernah 6 km).
  - Supir Gocar memperlakukan penumpang lebih baik daripada supir Grabcar memperlakukan penumpang.
    Mungkin karena Gojek lebih kejam ke supir.

* Databases? Designing databases?
Datafun[fn::https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC295d3V9gE]
 [fn::http://www.rntz.net/datafun/]

What Datomic brings to businesses[fn::https://medium.com/@val.vvalval/what-datomic-brings-to-businesses-e2238a568e1c]:
Interesting: inherent versioning, internally log-structured, internally append-only.
My only objection: database should be a library, not a separate operating system process.

What[fn::https://augustl.com/blog/2018/datomic_look_at_all_the_things_i_am_not_doing/]

Database design boils down to these questions:
- how do we store (arrange, lay out) data on disk?
- how do we make the database replicate automatically just by adding a node to a cluster?
  etcd?

Why do we store data?
Because we will need it later.
- accounting
- As a person, I don't need convenience store receipts. But a company needs them for accounting.

The stored data has to be findable/discoverable/rediscoverable.

** Pragmatic ontology: how pragmatism can help us answer what something is
(Is this really what others mean by "pragmatic ontology"?)

To the pragmatic ontologist, "exist" means "practically exist".

Someone who subscribes to egocentric pragmatic ontology would take the question "What is X?" to mean "What can I use X for? / How can I use X?"

- I can use it, therefore it exists. (Compare: Descartes's "I think, therefore I exist.")
- It affects me, therefore it exists.
** Gaining information by losing data?
(Do I understand what I'm talking about?)

It is possible to gain information while losing data.
We often gain information when we feed data to an irreversible function.
Example:
- array_length
- statistical summarization and interpretation
- modeling
But is that losing data?

Most interesting mappings are irreversible.
Modeling is irreversible mapping.

** Sloppy synecdoches: Is a "potato" a plant or a tuber?
A bean is a plant.

Let B be an individual, a bean plant.

Every individual of the species Solanum tuberosum is a plant.

Wrong: Potato is a plant => Every potato is a plant => forall x. potato(x) => plant(x)
A potato plant is a plant.
A potato is not a plant; a potato is a tuber.
Potato the whole plant vs potato the edible tuber.

Of course we can dismiss all this and just be sloppy with synecdoches,
but unclear language breeds unclear thinking.

*** Why is there no advanced Islamic country?

TLDR: I don't have an answer.

What is an Islamic country?

We can classify countries into four categories:
- non-Islamic non-advanced country (exists)
- Islamic non-advanced country (exists)
- non-Islamic advanced country (exists)
- Islamic advanced country (doesn't exist)

There are Islamic scholars.
Iran has nuclear power plants.
Such plants require advanced technical ability.

The problem is:
If there are enough religious extremists in a country,
then the whole country goes down.
The smart people die or move out, leaving only stupid people behind.
Stupid people beget more stupid people, deteriorating the country even faster.
People segregate themselves.

Forced democratization of a developing country only creates corrupt government.
For a government to be beneficial, the governed people must think critically.
The people of a developing country does not think critically.

Example of a developing country corrupted by forced democratization: Indonesia (and pretty much all developing countries).

Islam was created about 600 years after Christianity.
Does that mean Saudi Arabia in 2600 will be as advanced as the US in 2000?
Does that mean Saudi Arabia is 600 years behind the US?

Anyone who criticizes Islam risks death.
But one who rejects criticism is condemned to eternal backwardness.
If you are backward, you reject criticism.
If you reject criticism, you stay backward.
It's a vicious circle.
The only way out is waiting for backward people to die and be replaced with their children, hopefully more open-minded and capable of critical thinking and introspection.
But the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
The situation is extremely bleak.
We have billions of such people.

Muslim migrants create parallel societies and don't integrate?

*** Argument for killing stupid people?
- Premises:
  - People don't change.
    - Stupid is forever.
  - Survival is moral.
    If an action is necessary for survival, then it is moral.
    - Consequence: War for survival is moral.
      If there are only two people left on Earth, and there is only one last drip of water left on Earth,
      then it is moral for those people to go to war (that is, to harm the other) for that last drip of water.
    - Consequence: Retaliation is moral.
      It is moral for X to harm Y if Y harms X first.
  - Stupid people have been harming us.
- Conclusion?
  - It is moral to kill stupid people?
- Weaknesses and problems in the argument:
  - How do we define and determine stupidity?
    We should /not/ define "stupid" as "everyone who doesn't agree with us".
*** Analogy: fixing wrong building, fixing wrong children, fixing wrong people?
- The safest action is preemptive strike:
  - When you realize that you built a house wrong, you tear down the house, and rebuild it the right way.
    - Or, you just wait until a natural disaster destroys it, and then rebuild it.
      - Let's hope that you aren't in the building when disaster strikes.
  - When you realize that you raised your child wrong, you kill it (?), and make another child (?).
    - Or, you just wait for karma to kill your child, and have another child.
      - Let's hope that your child doesn't kill you first.
  - If people don't change, then the only way to fix deluded people / persistently misbehaving people is killing them (?).
    - Or, you just wait for a war or disaster.
      - Let's hope that you're not in the shithole when shit happens.
  - We programmers tear down rotten code all the time.
    We rewrite it from scratch.
    Why don't we tear down rotten societies as well?

** Company value extraction efficiency
Company value extraction efficiency = gross revenue attributable to employee labor / expenses attributable to employees

Amount stolen = profit = revenue - wage

Extraction efficiency = Amount stolen / wage

"Profit comes from the worth of the workers' labor minus their wage.
The difference is what is stolen."

If a capitalist finds better things for a worker to do, then:
- Is the capitalist entitled to the profits?
- Is the worker entitled to the profits?

How the Internet went wrong in 15 steps
http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/04/an-apology-for-the-internet-from-the-people-who-built-it.html
- "Step 1: Start With Hippie Good Intentions"
- "Step 4: [...] we paid a high price for keeping [the Internet] free"
  - "To avoid charging for the internet — while becoming fabulously rich at the same time — Silicon Valley turned to digital advertising."
  - Click maximization breeds sensationalism and extremism: /anything goes/, for a click.
    - Growth at all costs.
      Growth for the sake of growth.
      Idolization of growth.
      Growth is overrated.
      Growth isn't always desirable.
  - Tristan Harris: "We cannot afford the advertising business model. The price of free is actually too high.
    It is literally destroying our society, because it incentivizes automated systems that have these inherent flaws.
    Cambridge Analytica is the easiest way of explaining why that’s true.
    Because that wasn’t an abuse by a bad actor — that was the inherent platform.
    The problem with Facebook is Facebook."
- "Step 5: Everything was designed to be really, really addictive.
 The social-media giants became 'attention merchants', bent on hooking users no matter the consequences.
 'Engagement' was the euphemism for the metric, but in practice it evolved into an unprecedented machine for behavior modification."
  - Guillaume Chaslot: "The way AI is designed will have a huge impact on the type of content you see.
    For instance, if the AI favors engagement, like on Facebook and YouTube, it will incentivize divisive content, because divisive content is very efficient to keep people online."
- Internet business model that is not advertising
  - "Step 12: To fix it, we’ll need a new business model. Maybe [...] like charging users for goods and services"
  - I think Facebook/Twitter/Reddit/YouTube can make country-level subscription that countries pay using taxpayer money.
- "Step 14: Maybe nothing will change."
- What people say
  - Tim Berners-Lee: "The fact that power is concentrated among so few companies has made it possible to weaponize the web at scale."
  - Tim Cook: "I don’t have a kid, but I have a nephew that I put some boundaries on. There are some things that I won’t allow; I don’t want them on a social network."
  - Chamath Palihapitiya: "The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse, no cooperation; misinformation, mistruth. This is not about Russians’ ads. This is a global problem."

** Statistics, smoking, mindfulness
Seeing statistics worries me.
Most researchers don't understand statistics.
For example, I don't need statistics to know that smoking is bad; it's obvious.
It smells bad.
It makes me dizzy.

I guess people smoke because they have peer pressure, they have a weird sense of "cool", and they are too lazy to think for themselves.

Smoking always tastes bad.
Thus it is the rationalization that makes smokers tough it out.

How to stop smoking (Does it work?)

Remember when you first smoke cigarettes.
This is my guess.
It tastes bitter.
You cough.
Your eyes water.
It hurts.
But you tough it out.
You fear that your friends will leave you if you don't smoke.

I want you to taste every cigarette in the same way you tasted your first cigarette.
It's always the first time.
Feel the unpleasant bitter taste.
** The only way to change your adult son is to make him angry at himself.
I've been looking at fit boys and girls.

I'm reasonably average.
I don't have rare diseases.

The question is whether I /will/, not whether I /can/.
Of course I /could/; I just /wouldn't/.

My fucking mind invents various fucking excuses:

- I'll do it later.
- it's not good to exercise right before bedtime.

The key is to be /angry at yourself/.
A little self-hate is necessary.
Self-acceptance doesn't mean "give up and suck forever": this is defeatism.
Self-acceptance also doesn't mean "I'm beautiful and it's their problem if I'm fat":
this is entitlement mentality; this is delusion; this is not anchored on objective reality.

Imagine you're a boss, and you have this one guy who always come up with excuses.
Fucking fire him. He is you. Fire yourself. Now. Get fucking angry already.

Anger (but not rage) is necessary.
A person who never gets angry doesn't really want to live.
It is impossible to not get angry in the 21st century.
Everything is shitty.
Software is bloated, slow, and unreliable.
Governments are too big and wasteful.
Your job sucks.
Your children are good for nothing.
Your food is poisonous.
Religions murder people and hamper scientific progress.
Pandering politicians promise unfundable imaginary benefits.
What the fuck is going on?
Why the fuck do we let this happen?
Why aren't we angry?

Example of mindless thinking: the racing thoughts when I'm going to bed.
** Code of conduct
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't do things that you don't want to be done to you.
- Talk in cyberspace as you talk in meatspace.
  If you won't say it to someone you are talking with, don't write it on the Internet.

People nowadays get offended too easily.
It is possible to disagree without fighting.

What is an asshole?
If many people in the same room hate you, then maybe you are an asshole.

Swearwords show passion.
But if you use swearwords too often, they lose their meaning and impact.

Maybe sprinkle some smilies when you use swearwords.

But swearwords don't add meaning?

*** <2018-10-08> While a person is on a motorcycle (be it driving or not driving), he must secure his chattels, and not place them in shirt pockets, in order to prevent the chattels from falling to the road (therefore being lost or broken).
- Secure the chattels:
  - Put it in a /totally closed compartment/ in a bag, not in a pocket on the bag.
  - Grip the chattels.
- Triggers:
  - Eyeglasses fell from shirt pocket to the road, and were run over by the motorcycle behind.
  - A few months ago, a hairband fell from bag pocket to the road; it was lost.
  - Shit happened. Twice.

the greater the friendship.
How do we measure a sacrifice?
***** Measurement in theory
We define $F(A,B)$ (the /friendship measure from A to B/)
as how much sacrifice that A is willing to make for B.

(Is the direction correct? Is that backwards?)

Thus measuring friendship boils down to valuating sacrifices.

$F(A,B)$ can be approximated by an equivalent amount of money.
***** Measurement in practice
Foot-in-the-door:
let A ask B to make bigger and bigger sacrifices until B refuses.
Then we have found $F(A,B)$.

Door-in-the-face:
let A ask B to make a sacrifice so big that B refuses,
and then let A ask B to make smaller and smaller sacrifices until B accepts.
Then we have found $F(A,B)$.

Those results may differ, but $F(A,B)$ should lie somewhere between those two points.
We can also average them, take the maximum, take the minimum,
use interval arithmetics,
or describe the result using a statistical distribution, for example.
***** Properties
Friendship is circumstantial:
$F(A,B)$ changes over time.

Friendship is usually asymmetric:
$F(A,B) \neq F(B,A)$.
***** Questions
What is self-friendship?
What is $F(A,A)$?
How much is one willing to sacrifice for oneself?
Does this question even make sense?

**** Defining "boss"
- What is a boss?

  1. X is a /boss/ of Y iff X can affect Y's salary, even if X does it indirectly.
  2. X is a /strong boss/ of Y iff X has the authority to change Y's salary.
  3. X is a /weak boss/ of Y iff X is a boss, but not a strong boss, of Y.

- Example:

  - Everyone who can fire you is your strong boss.
  - Everyone who can get you fired (complain to someone who can fire you) is your weak boss.

- The stronger a boss is, the more seriously you should treat him/her.
- Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
***** Another definition, based on fear: X is a boss of Y if Y fears X.
**** Happiness
Happiness = Reality - Expectation.

To be more happy, raise reality, lower expectation, or do both.

Pain also reduces happiness.

Money cannot buy happiness,
but it can buys things that will make you happier.

Money helps, but after you have enough to make your life comfortable,
adding money doesn't add happiness.
*** Fear explains everything.
There are only two ways to make people do something:
- Make them want it.
- Make them fear the consequences of not doing it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_appeal
**** Explaining love/attachment as fear of loss...
**** Intrinsic motivation to do X is fear of the consequences of not doing X.
**** To want X is to fear not getting X.
**** We eat because we fear death. We eat because we fear regretting not tasting the delicious-looking food.
**** It is the terrorists/extremists who are afraid of us, in the same way a cornered rat biting us is afraid of us?
** Spreading information in an organization
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: spreading-information-in-an-organization
  :END:

- Two choices of where we can put the burden: the seeker and the source.

  - Polling: The person who needs an information seeks the person who might have it.
    This is hard because the person who needs an information might not realize that he needs the information. "Why wasn't I informed?"
  - Reacting: The person who has an information seeks the person who might need it.
    This is hard because this requires empathy and knowing the whole organization.

    - We can't depend on people.

  - Third way: There are people who specialize in collecting information from the sources and spreading information to the seekers.

- Which of those two systems is best?

  - I think the "polling" choice is the only sane choice.
    The "reacting" choice assumes too much about human altruism.

- A computer can help, but the final burden will always be on the seeker?

  - Mixture?

- 2009, thesis, "The most effective communication channel to spread information in an organization", Susanna Ketoja, [[http://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/6736][information]], [[http://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/6736/Ketoja_Susanna.pdf][pdf]]

  - The most effective way to spread information in an organization is a combination of email and informal meetings.
** Standardizing organizations
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: standardizing-organizations
  :END:

Building an organization that builds organizations.

Building an organization operating system.

- An organization is a group, a company, a business, a non-profit, etc..
- The goal: Every organization should use the same software for operations: accounting, financing, ERP, human resource management, issue tracking, workflow.
- Every library should use the same library information system.
- The organization can focus on its core competency.
- The business operations software should be so good that every organization uses it.
** Organizing knowledge
*** what
- Knowledge should be ordered descending by importance, from the most important?
- Knowledge should be ordered ascending by verifiability, from the easiest to verify?
- Knowledge should be grouped by usefulness?

  - If both Y and Z are useful to X, then Y and Z should be put together.

- Why does someone need to know something?

  - What is all the related things that he also needs to know?

- others

  - [[https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog882/l3_p3.html][Kant's Three Ways of Ordering Knowledge]]

- In what sequence should we present knowledge for fastest learning?
- Example of primitive life (but not survivalism?)

  - [[https://www.youtube.com/user/laws507/videos][YT:Primitive Life]]

- information organization

  - An information is a sentence, a paragraph, a picture, or anything that helps us accomplish something.

    - Here "information" is a countable noun.

  - Informations should be grouped by the task it helps us accomplish.

    - Every task T requires a set of informations, which should be put together in one place.
    - If doing task T requires informations J and K, then J and K should be grouped together.
    - Duplication problem.

      - Suppose: both task T and task U requires information J.
      - Where should J be put?

  - The value of information J should be measured by the ratio V/E, where V is the value of the task that J helps us accomplish, and E is our effort for obtaining J.
  - Example of combinatorial explosion of categories.

    - Which should a red car be grouped together with: a red hat or a blue car?

      - Which should a big old man be grouped together with: a big old woman, a big young man, or a small old man?

- The information organization of this wiki

  - At first I tried grouping by topic.
  - Then I asked myself, "Why am I collecting this information?"
  - Then I tried grouping by project (goals).
  - I switched from lookup-oriented knowledge organization (organize knowledge for refindability (fast lookup))
    to task-oriented (goal-oriented) knowledge organization (organize knowledge by the tasks that require the knowledge).

- Can machine organize information for us?
  Can machine cluster documents by the task they help accomplish?

** Magick
*** Wanted: replicable magick experiments
- Notes?

  - The presence of the experimenter affects the result?
  - The experiments may need to be repeated many times?

- Experiment ideas, ordered from the easiest to repeat:

  - Extrasensory perception

    - Astral projection

      1. Get a person (A) who can astral-project.
      2. Generate a bit X.
      3. Ask A about X.

    - Dream precognition

      - Telepathy

        1. Get two telepathic people A and B. (If you are telepathic yourself, you can be any one of them.)
        2. Generate a bit X (0 or 1) that only you and A know.
        3. Let A telepathically tell X to B. (Take care to isolate each of you to avoid sensory leakage.)
        4. Ask B about X.

    - Spirit possession

      - Procedure:

        1. Get two mediums A and B. (If you are a medium yourself, you can be A.)
        2. Get A to summon a spirit S.
        3. Generate a bit X (0 or 1) that only you and A know.
        4. Let A tell X to S.
        5. Get S into B. (This needs more detail.)
        6. Ask the S-possessed B about X.
           If he/she consistently knows, we may have a support for dualism.
        7. Get S out of B.

      - If the experiment result is promising,
        we can test the spirit's working memory capacity
        by replacing the bit X with a string, a number, a sentence, or whatever longer.
        The only important constraint is that you need to pick an X
        that is easy to remember but hard to guess.
      - Problems:

        1. Mediation may be tiring? (Can get another medium?)
        2. Spirits may refuse to cooperate? (Can get another spirit?)

  - Joint micropsychokinesis

    - What if many people try to influence a RNG at once?
      So far experiments one person influences a RNG at a time.
      Does the effect add up?

      - Is there even any effect at all?

- We might dismiss one person for hallucinating.
  Two unrelated honest people corroborating each other are less likely to be hallucinating.
  The more people say the same thing, the more serious the claim is.
  Not necessarily more true, but surely more serious.
  Most people are not pathological liars.

  - The facts may be correct, but the explanation may be unjustified.

** Maximizing lithium-ion battery life
- https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries
  - "Exposing the battery to high temperature and dwelling in a full state-of-charge for an extended time can be more stressful than cycling."
  - "In terms of longevity, the optimal charge voltage is 3.92V/cell."
  - "Every 70mV drop in charge voltage lowers the usable capacity by about 10%."
  - "Partial charging negates the benefit of Li-ion in terms of high specific energy."
  - "Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, reports that using a reduced charge level of 50% SOC increases the lifetime expectancy of the vehicle Li-ion battery by 44–130%."
  - "For safety reasons, many lithium-ions cannot exceed 4.20V/cell."
  - "Industrial devices, such as the EV, typically limit the charge to 85% and discharge to 25% to prolong battery life."
    - "Why Mobile Phone Batteries do not last as long as an EV Battery" https://batteryuniversity.com/index.php/learn/article/why_mobile_phone_batteries_do_not_last_as_long_as_an_ev_battery
  - "The question is asked, “Should I disconnect my laptop from the power grid when not in use?”
    Under normal circumstances this should not be necessary because charging stops when the Li-ion battery is full.
    A topping charge is only applied when the battery voltage drops to a certain level.
    Most users do not remove the AC power, and this practice is safe."
    - "Always keep the airflow unobstructed when running electric devices with air-cooling on a bed or pillow."

  - 1989, article, "Mathematical writing", Donald E. Knuth, Tracy Larrabee, and Paul M. Roberts, [pdf](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf)
    - "Many readers will skim over formulas on their first reading of your exposition.

- Reference articles
  - Which point of view should we use?
    - We can see a function as a special kind of relation.
    - We can see a relation from \( A \) to \( B \) as a function from \( A \) to \( 2^B \).
      - Every binary relation \((A,B,r)\) is a function \((A,2^B,f)\)

How to measure member contribution?
This is hard, if even possible at all.
Thus it's a bad idea to distribute profit according to member contribution.
An alternative way to distribute is
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs][WP:From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]],
but it only works if there is abundance.

**** Should we assume scarcity or abundance?

- Which assumption is better?
  - Assumption of scarcity: Human always wants more than what exists. There is never enough resources for everybody.
  - Assumption of abundance: There is a point where humans are satisfied. There are enough resources for everybody.

I think the assumption of abundance is saner.
But unfortunately it seems to lead to communism.

An economy consists of actors.

- No economic actor has complete view of the economy.

- Every actor responds only to what immediately affects it: its direct suppliers and consumers.
- Actors need time to respond to change in demand/supply.
- Some actors maintain buffers/inventories.
- Some actors get involved in futures.

Hypotheses:

- Shocks ripple through actors.
- Demand collapse may waste inventory.

Statistics can give us an accurate picture of the economy.

Is there evidence-based hiring like evidence-based medicine?

Can we use machine learning to hire people?

**** Uncertainty in hiring
In hiring, if a candidate leaves good impressions (not exceptional, but decent nonetheless), but you aren't sure about him, should you just reject him?
Does "maybe" mean "no"?
**** To avoid wasting time, begin with the most selective test.
Begin with the test with the highest failure ratio.
End the interview as soon as the candidates fail the test.
Respect their time and your time.
Don't force them to do what they can't do well.
Don't set them up to fail.
If you aren't going to hire them, don't waste their time.
**** Recruitment pipeline
- Review the resume / curriculum vitae.
**** You know your job ad is wrong when...
You know your job ad is wrong when you have to obviously reject a lot of candidates without thinking.

People don't read the job description.
People only read the job title.

To make sure that people read the job description, you can require that the applicant include a secret word that can only be found in the job ad.
Auto-reject people who don't read the job description.

**** Cantonese

The biggest problem of Cantonese:
it doesn't have /standard/ romanization like Hanyu Pinyin, does it?
Cantonese has three: Jyutping Romanization, Yale Romanization, and Cantonese Pinyin.
It unnecessarily fragments learning resources.

***** Some Indonesian vernaculars
Spoken Indonesian is wildly different from written Indonesian and news Indonesian.
On the street, nobody speak like news anchors.
****** Dong, kek
"Gitu dong!" (with emphasis on tu)
"Nah, gitu dong!"
"Gitu kek dari tadi!"
That's what I wanted you to do!
If only you had shut up and done that earlier,
we wouldn't have had to fight.

"Iiiih diem dong!"
(Can't you shut up!?)

"Ga bisa gitu dong!"
"Enak aja lu!"
"Apaan!?"
"Dari mana!?"
"Atas dasar apa!?"
(Typical response to outrage-inducing unfairness, injustice, or absurdity.
What the hell?
You can't do that!)
****** Doang, sih, aja
"Gitu doang?"
(Is that all? Is that all you got?)

"Segitu doang kemampuanlu? Cupu banget sih lu!"
(Is that all you got? You piece of shit!)

"Kenapa sih tiap kali gua datang, ada aja masalah..."
(I'm dying to know why there is always a problem every time I come.)

"Gitu doang ngambek"
"Gitu aja marah"
(Why the hell are you angry for such trivial thing?)

"Coba diem dulu deh!!"
Can't you shut up for a while?

"Eh ini enak. Cobain deh..."
This is delicious. Here, try some!

"Iya aja deh"
"Apa katalu dah"
(Whatever you say.)

"Masih aja!"
(Why the hell are you still doing this?
Haven't I told you to stop already?)

"Ini aja?" (Is this everything?)
"Iya ini aja"
"Iya ini doang" (Yes, it's everything.)
****** Deh
"Eh iya deh."
(Oops, I was wrong.)
(Oops, I just remembered.)

"Iya maaf deh."
(Sorry. Whatever. Are you happy now?)
****** Kok
"Kok lu masih idup?"
(Why the hell are you still alive?)

"Kok lu di sini?"
"Kok lu di sini sih?"
(Why are you here? You aren't supposed to be here.)

"Udah dikerjain kok PR-nya Ma."
(What the hell are you accusing me for Mum?
I have done my homework, you know.)

A: "Eh ini kok gini? dapet dari mana?"
(Huh? Why is this? Where does this come from?)
B: "Ya iya dong. Masa gini aja lu ga ngerti?"
(I'm getting impatient.
Isn't it obvious?
You can't understand something this simple?)

"Gitu aja kok repot" (trademark alm. Gus Dur)
"Why so much hassle over such small matter?"
(I think Joker's (as played by Heath Ledger) "Why so serious?" also fits this somewhat.)
****** Lah, lho or loh
"Ya begitulah"
(More or less that's the case.)

"Ya begitulah"
(a vague and rather polite response that does not mean anything;
this avoids making the other party think you are ignoring him/her)

"Ya begitulah"
"Ya begitulah... lu tau sendiri kan"
"Mau gimana lagi?"
仕方ない
(Nothing can be done about it; What else can be done?)

"Lho kok masih di sini?"
(Why the hell are you still here?)

"Lho kok belum dikerjain?"
(Why the hell haven't you done this?)

"Iya lho"
"Bener lho"
(I'm serious. I'm not lying.)

"Lho lho lho"
(Wait, what?)

"Gue gitu loh"
(Of course I can do that. I'm the greatest.)
****** Toh
"Oh gitu toh"
そうですか。
なるほど。

***** How does swapping the subject and the predicate changes the meaning of a copular sentence (a sentence whose verb is the copula)? Subject-predicate asymmetry?
We consider sentences of these forms: "X is Y" and "Y is X", where each of X and Y is a noun phrase.

We are interested in how swapping X and Y changes the meaning of the sentence.

*** Learning to play mahjong
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: learning-to-play-mahjong
  :END:

The variant discussed here is classic Chinese mahjong.

**** Basic facts
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: basic-facts
   :END:

There are 136 mahjong tiles,
of which 52 are dealed to the players.
The remaining 84 forms the wall.
Thus, in a play, you only get at most 21 chances to change your hand,
that is 84 divided by 4 (the number of players).

If each player takes 15 seconds, then a hand
will take at most 4 x 15 x 21 = 1,260 seconds (21 minutes).

There are 136 tiles (not including 4 flower tiles and 4 season tiles):

There are 3 suits (bams, dots, and chars). Each suit has 9 classes. Each number has 4 instances. Thus each suit has 36 tiles. Thus there are 108 suit tiles.

There are 7 honors (4 winds and 3 dragons). Each honor has 4 instances. Thus there are 28 honor tiles.

There are 27 suit classes and 7 honor classes, giving a total of 34 classes.

Each tile class has 4 instances.

Each tile is equally probable to be drawn.

The probability of picking a tile class is 4/136. The odds of picking a tile class is 4:132.

**** Number of chows, pungs, and kongs
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: number-of-chows-pungs-and-kongs
   :END:

The probability of drawing a pung:
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 * 2/134 = 1/3,015 (odd of 1 : 3,014, approx 1 : 3,000)

Each suit has 7 unique chows: 123, 234, 345, 456, 567, 678, 789.
There are 3 suits, so there are 21 unique chows.
Each tile has 4 instances.
Each chow has 4^3 instances.
The probability of drawing a chow: 21 * 4^3 / (136 * 135 * 134) = 28 / 51,255
(odd of 1 : 51,227, approx 1 : 51,000).

Pung is more likely than chow. Is this a calculation mistake?

The probability of drawing a kong (four identical tiles):
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 * 2/134 * 1/133 = 1/400,995 (odd of 1 : 400,994, approx 1 : 401,000)

The probability of drawing a pair:
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 = 1/45 (odd of 1 : 44)

The probability of drawing two tiles having the same class:
4/136 * 3/135 = 1/1,530 (odd of 1 : 1,529)

The probability of drawing two tiles having the same suit (3 suits):
3 * 36/136 * 35/135 = 7/34 (odd of 7 : 27, approx 1 : 4)

The probability of drawing a chow:
The probability of drawing n, n+1, n+2 unordered of the same suit, for n in 1 to 7:

3! * 3 * 7 * 4/136 * 4/135 * 4/134 = 56/17,085 (odd of 56 : 17,029, about 1 : 304)

The probability of drawing a pair, given that one tile has been drawn by another player:

Let each player draw exactly one tile. The probability of four players drawing the same tile:
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 * 2/134 * 1/133 = the probability of drawing a kong

    - Every word changes the intention/meaning of the query.

      - What operation does the RWI (reverse word index) speed up?

        - RWI is a hash table that maps a word to a URL.
          An entry (k,v) in the RWI means that the word k is found in the document at the URL v.
        - What is the relationship between RWI and inverted index?

          - An RWI is an inverted index.

    - YaCy doesn't have DHT (distributed hash table) routing.
      What does that mean?
      Why would one want DHT routing?
      Why would DHT imply routing?

    - Setting up YaCy

      - Clone YaCy GitHub
      - Prepare isolation

        - =sudo adduser --system --group yacy=
        - =sudo adduser $SUDO_USER yacy=, replace =$SUDO_USER= with your non-yacy user
        - =sudo chown -R yacy:yacy=

      - Build YaCy

        - =sudo -u yacy -H /bin/bash= for shell
        - In that shell:

          - =ant clean all=

      - Start YaCy

        - Still in the yacy shell:

          - =./startYACY.sh -f= to start YaCy in foreground

      - Use YaCy

        - Open [[http://localhost:8090/]]

      - Can we make it easier to setup YaCy peer network?

        - My scenario is typical:

          - I'm behind two layers of NAT: my ISP's router, and my USB-tethered Android phone.
          - Overlay network? VPN? Hosting on cloud?

      - Should we host YaCy on GCP (Google Cloud Platform)?
        It's cheap (USD 4.28 per month in us-west-1/us-central-1/us-east-1? Really? What about network data transfer costs into?).
        It might be even cheaper (GCP free tier).

        - Even cheaper: Run YaCy on GCE preemptible instances?
        - alternative: DigitalOcean? https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/

      - YaCy, Solr, who knows what, sometimes runs out of memory.
        How come?
      - Does YaCy deal with stemming and synonyms?

    - How does YaCy use Solr?

**** Solving the Israel-Palestine problem
- I propose this for the Israel-Palestine problem:

  - Country

    - Establish a new country (say "Ispal"), merging Israel and Palestine.

  - Government

    - Everyone in the Israeli government is in the Ispalian government.
    - Everyone in the Palestinian government is in the Ispalian government.

  - Land

    - The land of Ispal is the land of Israel plus the land of Palestine.

  - Citizen

    - Every Israeli is an Ispalian.
    - Every Palestinian is an Ispalian.

  - Law

    - Every Ispalian is equal before the law.

  - Why this might not be accepted

**** violin
This is my study notes, observations, and conclusions.
This is a bit disorganized.

I play the violin without chin rest and shoulder rest.
***** The right pinky
The right pinky is for playing softly:
tilt the bow very slightly by pressing down the pinky (with the thumb as the fulcrum).
XXX: Is it by flexing the pinky or by supinating the hand?

Playing softly is harder than playing loudly.
Playing softly also uses more tension than playing loudly.
***** Squeaking
Each bow speed has a range of pressure that will make a good sound.
Less bow speed needs less pressure.
The symptom of too much pressure for a bow speed is squeaking;
increase the bow speed, or decrease the bow pressure, or both.

Decrease the bow pressure by pressing the end of the bow with the right pinky,
with the thumb as the fulcrum.
***** Playing open strings
Open strings, especially the A and E strings,
sound brighter than stopped strings,
so open strings will be perceived as louder
even though the bow speed and pressure stay the same.
In order to play scales with even dynamics,
we can avoid open strings,
or we can bow the open strings more softly
with reduced pressure and speed.

Also, we can play the D string nearer to the bridge to brighten it,
and the A string nearer to the fingerboard to darken it,
to make the change from the D to the A string smoother.
***** Idea for group practice
Learning Kreutzer etudes together?
***** Bouncing bows
The hairs act as a spring.

Vertical component of stick-slip.

Act as torque with the right thumb as the fulcrum.

*** <2016-03-22> The reason for the name spacetimecat.com
In jazz-speak, a /cat/ is a jazz musician, and
I'm a jazz musician traveling through spacetime;
hence the name /spacetime cat/.

However, most importantly, the domain is a dot-com,
and it was available, untouched by rent-seeking domain speculators.

Another reason is that the name isn't tied to shady stuffs
and doesn't have unwanted connotations.
A quick google shows that the worst result
for 'spacetime cat' is cat pictures,
which should be pretty safe for everyone
except perhaps a few extreme cat haters.

It's also nice that the name
isn't too hard to remember or spell,
but it's hard to get it wrong.

Hence I bought spacetimecat.com.

"When I was in 7th grade, my math teacher answered an obvious but difficult question:
Why do we have to study advanced math, if we are never going to use it in our adult lives?
He said it’s because the same parts of our brains used for math can be used for many other things in life.
With this short explanation, he utterly convinced me the importance of studying math, and of any other subjects for that matter."

** <2018-11-19> I changed my mind. Now I think most of this page is a waste of time.
Thanks to John Stossel and Steve Patterson.

If I could solve the libertarian children problem, I would be a libertarian by now.

Is antinatalism against nature?
Yes, if humans have innate drive to breed (to have have an offspring).
No, if humans have innate drive to fuck only (to satisfy the genitals, not including breeding).

I'm more inclined toward survivalism than antinatalism.

Antinatalism is noble but impractical.
The reality is that billions of low-IQ people are going to fuck and breed anyway,
producing low-IQ children who never question anything, repeating the stupidity of their parents, perpetuating the cycle.
But this may be practical in the future:
Inconspicuous forced mass sterilization!
Airborne human-sterilizing nanobots!
Human-sterilizing viruses!
Infertility-causing foods!

Is this just a waste of time?
Is this going to change anything?

Goal:
Establish a benevolent dictatorship with these principles:
- Peace of mind.
  - No overtime.
  - No deadlines.
  - No loans.
  - If growth robs you of peace of mind, don't grow.

** Anarchism?
1995 book "What Is Anarchism? An Introduction"
https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/donald-rooum-and-freedom-press-ed-what-is-anarchism-an-introduction
*** Letter to anarchists: Say "self-governance" instead of "anarchism"; focus on making what you want, not on avoiding what you hate
Your goal is noble, but, for your message to be acceptable by the people,
you must use the word "self-governance" instead of "anarchy".
No need to change anything else, just replace all occurrences of "anarchy" with "self-governance".
This will make your speeches and writings infinitely more acceptable
to the uneducated people that you need.
No more wasting time explaining what "anarchy" really is.

It does not benefit you to use a word that has been redefined by everyone else.
Your meaning of "anarchy" dates back to Proudhon's 1840 treatise "What is property?"
It's 2018, almost 200 years since Proudhon,
and the topmost Google search result for "anarchy" today
is "a state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority".
You see, even the dictionaries and the Internet are conspiring against you.
Nobody wins a fight against the Internet.
You need a new word.

The word "anarchy" focuses on the absence of a ruler.
It gives the impression that you are a belligerent forever
plotting a coup d'etat against your nemesis the government.
You don't want that.
You want to maximize everyone's freedom,
and you want people to associate voluntarily,
which is to say that they self-govern.
The word "self-governance" gives the impression that you are
a youthful progressive bunch of people
with positive success mindset brimming with can-do attitude.
It sounds like bullshit, but flowery bullshit sells better than ugly truth.

It's unfortunate that words change meanings, but language changes with the people who speak it.
You won't see any progress until you change the word you use to spread your message.

The word "anarchy" is, in today's context, bad for marketing your cause.

Thus, from now on, say and write "self-governance" instead of "anarchy".

- Happiness = Expectation - Reality.
- Advertising increases expectation.

*** Deregulation of USA

Trump needs a cooperative Congress in order for him to be able to repeal more laws.

*** Antonin Scalia: The key to American freedom is the separation of power, not the Bill of Rights.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ggz_gd--UO0

The USSR Constitution guarantees more freedom than the USA Constitution, but the USSR failed to prevent the centralization of power.

Every dictatorship has bill of rights.

North Korea has elections.

*** Evolution justifies governments

Evolution suggests that cooperation improves survival (in the long run, of the species, not of an individual).

Evolution suggests that morality improves survival.

Evolution suggests that government improves survival.

What is the state for?
Why do we need government?
To promote the survival of the governed species.

**** Government is not to merely maintain public order.

Public order can be undesirable:

- We don't want a government that oppresses people in order to maintain public order.
- The overthrowing of a tyrant may be a desirable public disorder.

To promote survival of the people? As in evolution?

To better the people?
To impose the morality of the people?
A government reflects the morality of its people.

We must impose our morality on others.
The law imposes the lawmakers' morality on everyone.
It is practically impossible to live without imposing your morality on others.
There is a minimum decency that we expect when we interact with others.

The enforcement of law is an imposition of the morality of the lawmakers (and therefore of the people who elected the lawmakers).

https://www.quora.com/Should-the-law-impose-morality

**** Social apoptosis? Programmed human death?

Some cells must die to better the organism.
Some people should die to better the society?
Programmed cell death ~ programmed human death?

A malfunctioning cell kills itself.
It would be nice if a malfunctioning human could kill himself?

A cell infected by a virus kills itself.
It would be nice if a human infected by ideological virus (mind virus) could kill himself?

How do we know we're infected?

**** Why should our survival be desirable at all?

**** Human rights are legal fiction.

What is real is tolerance.
People let other people live.
If I am still alive, it's because others let me live,
because others tolerate me,
not because I have any rights.

** Law
*** The ideal law enforcement
- Describe the case to a computer (such as a Prolog program).
- The computer suggests relevant laws.
  The judge still makes the final decision though.
  The judge uses restorative justice.
*** what
- There is something above the law: violence, that is, power, that is, human nature.
  - Law is whatever people fear.
  - Power is the ability to do violence (bodily harm).
  - Weapon is power multiplier.
    Weapon multiplies the ability to do violence.
  - People who are above the law are above the law because they have more power than the police.
    Example of those people are extremely rich people, including big corruptors.
    Such powerful people have enough money to do more violence than the police can do.
  - Religious demonstrators are above the law because they can do more violence than the police can do.
    - The police must develop non-lethal crowd-control weapons.
- Law requires the ability to do violence.
- Law isn't about truth.

*** Making good laws
Good laws satisfactorily answers:

- How are we going to enforce it?
- What is the worst that haters can do?
- What questions might arise?
- What undefined cases?

Good laws:

- Can be enforced practically (sane effort and cost)
- Addresses the root cause of the problem
- Minimizes unintended effects (is well-targeted)
- Is complete (handle all cases) and Leaves no questions
- Is timeless/future-proof (doesn't depend on time) (is this even possible?)

People are creative.
They will find ways around laws.

Questionable example: even-odd car license plate rule.
If cars are cheap, then people will just buy two cars.
The root cause of the problem is bad/expensive/unintegrated public transport.

Bad example: legislating morality.
Are you going to visit each of the 100 million homes and install a camera?

*** About this post
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-post
    :END:

This post contains serious questions but no answers.
The questions were made with complete respect to all religions.

**** How to benefit from the questions
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: how-to-benefit-from-the-questions
     :END:

Answer them honestly in your mind.
You can choose to keep your answers to yourself,
so please be completely honest to yourself.

Please do not feel stupid.
Honesty is not stupidity.
Not being able to answer a question does not imply stupidity.

If you are a religious person and you answer the questions seriously,
then these are some possible outcomes:

1. You ignore these questions or refuse to answer them.
   If you think I'm just trying to confuse you,
   please know that I respect your time,
   and I'm trying to help you.
   The questions are hard because they are serious questions, not riddles.
   I'm sorry if what I thought would be good turns out to be bad for you.
2. You invent new rationalizations
   (
   e.g. the author is committing a logical fallacy,
   all good people can go to heaven regardless of their religion,
   all religions basically teach good things,
   my religion might not be the best but it's the one I'm most familiar with,
   etc.).

*** The questions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: the-questions
    :END:

**** Conversion
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: conversion
     :END:

If a person leaves Islam and joins Christianity,
then Allah will punish him, but Jesus will save him,
so what will happen?

**** Correctness
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: correctness
     :END:

- Is your religion /the/ correct religion?

  - If yes, are people with other religions unable to go to heaven?

    - If no, why don't you try their religions?
      Aren't you going to heaven regardless of which one yours is?

  - If no, why do you still believe in something you know is wrong
    instead of looking for the correct one?

    - If you think all religions are correct, why don't you try other religions?
      Aren't you going to heaven regardless of which one yours is?
    - If you think there's no such thing as /the/ correct religion,
      why do you have any religion at all?
      Why would you believe in something you know is not correct?
      Why would you gamble your afterlife?

If all people with religion can go to heaven,
why not choose the religion that requires
the least effort to go to heaven?

**** Experiments

- Attacking people's beliefs will activate their amygdala,
  resulting in fight-or-flight response?
- Every religion started out as something good.
  It civilized its community.
  However, after 1000 years, people got too attached to religion, and religion loses its benefits.

  - History of Islam

    - Islam civilized Arabia.

        - Before Islam, Arabia consisted of constantly warring tribes.

      - Before Islam, a man can take an unlimited number of wives.
      - Islam limited it to four, and requires that the man take care of the wives properly.

        - That's a big change: from unlimited to four!

- To everyone, especially religious people:

  - Why do you let someone else decide what/how you should think?

*** Hypothesis: Before science, religion helped humanity survive.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: hypothesis-before-science-religion-helped-humanity-survive.
   :END:

Religion, superstition, and folk tales had evolutionary benefit.

Before science, religion was humankind's best attempt at understanding reality.

Understanding reality helps survival.

The paranoid is more likely to survive.
*** A fiction of Ali and Bob
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: a-fiction-of-ali-and-bob
  :END:

Ali is a good Muslim.
Bob is a good Christian.
They are good friends.

But then Ali reads [[http://quran.com/74/42-47][Quran 74:42-47]],
and Bob reads [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16-20&version=NIV][John 3:16-20]].

Each of them wants to go to their respective heaven,
and as good friends, each of them also wants the best for the other,
which is for the other to go to heaven,
but they aren't sure whose heaven:
Ali's holy book implies that Bob is going to the Islamic hell,
and Bob's holy book implies that Ali is going to the Christian hell.

They can't bear the dissonance, but don't want to live as enemies either,
and they don't want to assume that their friend is wrong,
for such assumption would justify their converting their friend,
and they think the other won't like any proselytizing,
because they don't like being proselytized themselves,
and they won't do unto others what they don't want others to do unto them.
They don't want to reduce their friendship into mere tolerance;
thus they throw away their holy books and religions,
and they stay good friends until their death,
while still believing in a higher power.

**** Postscript
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: postscript
   :END:

This is not the
argument from inconsistent revelations
(also known as the aptly named 'the problem of avoiding the wrong hell').
This story is about humanity, not gods.

  - We should choose the one with the highest return of investment.

    - The one with the least obligations but the most rewards.
    - Thus we should also make afterlife easier.
    - We should seek the one with the minimal rules, beliefs, rituals, commitments.
    - We have always been making life easier (by technology).

      - We should make afterlife easier too.

  :END:

(Part of this was posted on https://www.reddit.com/r/indonesia/comments/6y5yvc/atheistagnostic_komodos_whatwhen_was_your/dmlscxr/)

For every pair of religions R1 and R2, there is always a sentence S such that S is true in R1 but S is not true in R2.
Therefore, it cannot be the case that both R1 and R2 are true.
Sometimes a religion is not even consistent.
A religion R is inconsistent iff there is a sentence S such that both S and the negation of S is in R.
[[https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&q=how+many+religions][There are 4200 religions.]]
They cannot all be true.
At most only one of them can be true.
It can also be the case that all of them are not true.

*** Religions in 2018
- https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/24/18018446/follow-jc-go-pokemon-go-clone-vatican
*** Hypothesis about the origin of religions and the evolutionary benefit of religions
- Religion evolved from folk tales.
- Religion evolved from our ability to personify things.
- Religion, superstition, and folk tales were the best tool for survival before modern healthcare.
- Superstition and religion helped people survive.
  Superstitious people are more paranoid and less likely to die for stupid reasons.
- Religion is learned paranoia and culturally-spread paranoia.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundredth_monkey_effect
  - "The *hundredth monkey effect* is a hypothetical phenomenon in which a new behaviour or idea
    is claimed to spread rapidly by unexplained means from one group to all related groups
    once a critical number of members of one group exhibit the new behaviour or acknowledge the new idea."

** Religiosity causal chain
- A child has a religion because its parents teach it that religion.
  - Parents may revolt if we forbid them from teaching religion to their children.
- A person leaves religion because he disagrees with the religion or how others practice it.
- A person wants to apply religion because he sees it as an ideal.
- Can we send subliminal messages on TV to make religions look bad?
- People are more religious in bad times because religion numbs the pain somewhat. Religion is a psychological painkiller. Religion is addictive.
  - If we give them real-pain killing drugs, will they replace their addiction?
- People are religious because they are afraid to think for themselves. They are afraid of the unknown?
- People are religious because they fear becoming irreligious.
- How do we passivate religious people?

Poor people are more religious?

** Money, wealth, and poverty: traversing the causal chain from the proximate cause to the ultimate cause
These are two /different/ questions:
- Why does someone become rich or poor?
- Why is someone rich or poor?

A person becomes rich due to sustained surplus.
A person becomes poor due to sustained deficit.
A surplus enriches a person.
A deficit impoverishes a person.
If his expenses consistently exceeds his income, he will become poor.

Is his expenses too high?
Is his income too low?
*** Mutual causes, vicious circles; poverty, homelessness
TLDR:
Poverty causes homelessness.
Homelessness exacerbates poverty.

Which causes which, between poverty and homelessness?
To find out, answer both "How does a poor person become homeless?" and "How does a homeless person become poor?".

If the poor can increase his income, he will be able to buy a home.
But to increase his income, he need to have a home (a mailing address) first.
It's catch-22.

If the poor can get a home but not increase his income, he will lose the home, and he will be homeless again.

A homeless person doesn't have a mailing address.
Thus he can't create a bank account.
Thus he can't apply for a job.
Thus he has no income.
Thus he becomes poor.

A poor person has a house.
Thus he needs money to buy food.
Thus he sells his house.
Thus he becomes homeless.
Thus he ends up even poorer.

** Analogy: Marx were a doctor, capitalism were the disease, Marxism was the cure that was worse than the disease.
- Jordan Peterson Vs Marxist Professor Richard Wolff https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTj17c4N9vI
  - Marx predicted some bad consequences of capitalism, but the cure he proposed was worse than the disease.
  - However, Jordan Peterson says that inequality is not due to capitalism, but because small successes breeds even bigger successes.
    - When something good happens to you, it increases the probability that something else good also happens to you.

** Does Wikileaks matter? Who is going to scour all that text for interesting stuffs / incriminating evidence? Most people don't have time to read that.
** All fierce debates are language problems
Communication consists of input, processing, and output.

In a fierce debate, there is no input; there is only output, and the participants don't even agree about the definitions.
They don't know what they are talking about.
** This may be biased; speculations about China
*** Speculations
These are the possible scenarios:
- The oppressed thinks that they are already dead (their lives are worse than death) anyway,
  musters enough strength, revolts, and overthrows the government.
  The non-oppressed (the middle-class) takes collateral damage.
- The government kills off all oppressed people.
  The non-oppressed people lives in their bubble happily ever after.
- The government slowly releases control while trying to save face.

Xi Jinping cannot release control in 2018, because if he releases control, his opponents will pounce on him, reveal all his crimes, and tarnish his name.
Xi Jinping wants to die in good standing, with good reputation; he wants to be remembered as a good person.

I hope that the next bloodshed gives the Chinese people enough reason to limit government power.

You can live a good comfortable life in China as long as you blind yourself from the truth.

Stalin's inner circle was too afraid to tell him the truth.
Nobody dared to challenge Stalin.
Stalin's inner circle told him what he wanted to hear.

https://www.quora.com/Is-is-true-that-top-Soviet-officials-lived-in-constant-fear-under-Stalin-Or-is-that-an-exaggeration

After Stalin died, there was a great purge.

You know your country is led by an authoritarian if:
- You can't say the truth there.
- There is someone whom people are too afraid to disagree with, even politely.

We must respect the truth.
The truth doesn't care about us.
People who ignore the truth do so at their own peril.
Ignoring the truth means ignoring some danger;
such ignorance reduces the chance of survival.

** Why the non-oppressed people must help the oppressed people
Because when the oppressed people revolt, the non-oppressed people will be among the victims.
** Is the world better without private ownership?
Nobody needs to be rich?
What we really seek is satisfaction.
We should be happy if others find us useful, if others want us to stay, if others want us to exist.

If people's basic needs are met, they will still work, but they will only do what they really want to do.

Personal property is OK.
Is private non-moving property OK?

** <2018-09-24> Competition is wasteful
Suppose that Company A and Company B both make System S.
They duplicate each other's efforts.
Then Company B loses.
Thus everything B (and all other losers) did is /wasted/.

- If a company doesn't have any competitors, it has little incentive to improve.
  (We assume that companies only improve when they are existentially threatened.)
- How do we make sure that something improves even without competition?
  /Guilds/.
  An organization that /intrinsically/ wants to improve (while still profiting),
  not an organization that intrinsically wants to maximize profit at all costs.

- Can we tell apart the liars from the honest people?

As long as media optimizes themselves for maximum traffic (for advertising), people like Trump are going to win.

Raising minimum wage increases unemployment

He did it to pressure everybody to pressure Wal-Mart (an Amazon competitor).

Governments shouldn't guarantee bank deposits.
Governments should not encourage people to save too much money at banks.
Governments should encourage trade.

Employers love immigration.
Immigration makes cheap workers.
Illegal immigrants are even cheaper.

The pro-immigration people hide that desire behind pretend humanitarianism.
They don't care about cultural stability, as they live in their safe enclaves, protected by the government they bribe, far away from where immigrants live.

*** Minimum wage hurts the very people it is supposed to protect.
First, pandering politicians raise minimum wage.

Then, companies scramble to avoid bankruptcy.
A company has several options:
- Do nothing; keep the workers, bear the cost. (Do you think the company will happily accept the reduced profit, if it still profits at all?)
- Raise prices, passing costs to buyers. (But then the buyers will buy less. Law of supply and demand.)
- Cut costs by reducing quality. (But will the buyers still buy?)
- Train the workers to make them more productive. (But how far can we train people?)
- Fire the workers, move to somewhere with cheaper workers.
- Fire the workers, buy robots.

Political propaganda can't change the basic economic law of supply and demand.
This law is more fundamental than the politician-made laws.
Political fantasy can't change economic reality.
Ignore reality at your own peril.

I think workers should negotiate with their employers, and there is no need to involve government.

Disagreements.

- The role of the media in politics:
    - The media should research/watch/monitor/summarize/audit the government for the public.
    - The media should therefore be owned by the public, and independent of the government. The media should not be funded with tax.
    - The media shapes the public opinion.
    - The media bridges the government and the public.
    - The public doesn't have the time to watch the government.
- The media is the public's opinion of the government.
- The media is whatever the public sees.
    - Shadow/private media: social media, websites, chat groups.
        - "Shadow" in the same sense as "shadow banking".
            - "Shadow" here means unofficial/non-traditional but effective.
        - They may contain hoaxes, fake news, disinformations, and the like.
- How do the public form opinion?
    - Public opinion is country-scale groupthink?

    - Penggunaan bahan bakar (fuel mileage), 5 km/liter, Rp 10000/liter
    - Kecepatan rata-rata 50 km/jam
    - Kendaraan beroperasi 24 jam per hari = 1200 km/hari = 240 liter/hari
  - Biaya perawatan kendaraan Rp ?/bulan
  - Asuransi kesehatan Rp ?/bulan

Forcing someone to live the life he does not want is more immoral than killing him.
This also implies:

- We should let people kill themselves if they have thought about it well, as long as they are done privately.
  - But https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2013/05/19/why-stop-someone-from-suicide/ dissents:
    - "The most important reason to prevent suicide is that suicidal crises, though formidable and painful, almost always are temporary.
      Even if the person continues thinking about suicide, the intense suicidal intent usually subsides.
      Consider that 90% of people who survive a suicide attempt do not go on to die by suicide.
      That number is very revealing.
      Even among people who wanted to die so strongly that they tried to end their life, most ultimately chose to live."
      - People don't know what they want.
        We don't know what we want.

*** Prinsip ekonomi

- Mandirikan bangsa.
  Maksimalkan produksi dalam negeri.
  Kemandirian adalah syarat perlu tetapi tidak cukup untuk kedaulatan.

*** Kurangi nilai impor.

- Tingkatkan produksi dalam negeri, terutama industri strategis, teknologi.
- Bangun daerah tertinggal, kurangi urbanisasi.

- Giving money to poor people immediately increases their purchasing power, but there are consequences.
- They buy things, increasing demand.
- If there is not enough supply, then prices rise.
- Conclusion:

  - In the short term, cash transfers provides immediate relief to poor people.
  - In the long term, cash transfers hurts the poor people it intends to help.
  - To help the poor, the government should increase the supply of goods to the poor.

    - Ideal permanent strategic solution: increase aggregate efficiency to drive down costs.

      - Localize production.
        Avoid transportation.
        Transportation is waste.
      - Depend on renewable energy.
        The sun is free!

Pasal 36: "Kecuali diperjanjikan lain, Pencipta dan Pemegang Hak Cipta atas Ciptaan yang dibuat dalam hubungan kerja atau berdasarkan pesanan yaitu pihak yang membuat Ciptaan."
Ini berarti "Pencipta" dan "Pemegang Hak Cipta" bisa didefinisikan ulang oleh perjanjian kerja.

Pasal 41: "Hasil karya yang tidak dilindungi Hak Cipta meliputi: [...]
b. setiap ide, prosedur, sistem, metode, konsep, prinsip,

** Flat Earth is a social issue, not a scientific issue
Flat-Earthers are merely looking for friends in this extremely power-unbalanced world.
They have trust issues with authorities.
I am also looking for friends who share my beliefs, and I also have trust issues with authorities,
but the difference between a Flat-Earther and me is that
I have trust issues with political authorities,
whereas a Flat-Earther has a trust issue with scientific authorities.
Thus, although I do not believe in Flat Earth,
a Flat-Earther and I have more commonalities than differences.
The same is true with Holocaust deniers and climate change deniers:
it is a trust issue with some authorities.

How did such trust issues arise?
Our parents, for good reason, taught us not to trust strangers.
Thus it is a logical consequence that we don't trust authorities: they are strangers!
We don't know who they are, and yet they suddenly come down telling us what is right and what is wrong.

How can two strangers be friends?
By physical closeness (being at nearby location and time) and by mental closeness (having similar ideas and beliefs).
How do we make sure that the people in power are not strangers?
It is not feasible for one person to meet millions of people.
Thus I have this corollary: /having power over more people always begets more trust issues/, simply because it is harder for the authority to not be strangers with its subjects.
Perhaps it's just that power today is too centralized.
But mass media enables centralization of power;
the authority uses mass media to make its subjects feel that the authority is familiar.
But mass communication is one-way communication.
How does one-way communication build trust?
In the same way an actor builds his fanbase of fans who trust him.
First, the would-be fans have to fall in love with him from afar, be it due to his handsomeness, his charisma, or any aspect of him that resonates with them.
But then this fanbase has to be maintained, and it is physically impossible for an actor with a million fans to be close to all of them.
Therefore what is required to maintain the fanbase is a /mass illusion/ of closeness:
the actor has to behave in such a way that makes his fans /perceive/ that he cares about /all/ of them,
whereas he can only /actually/ care about /few/ of them.
The mass media only has to show the actor's interacting with /a few/ of his fans, in order to make /all/ of his fans feel that they have been interacted with.
This is not because he is evil; he is just constrained by the laws of physics.
This technique is a double-edged sword:
it can be used to maintain political stability,
but it can also be used to lie to millions of people.
We need to teach people epistemology so that they can tell apart what they know and what they think they know.
Mass media does not give any knowledge; it only gives an illusion of knowledge.
Reading the news does not make us know anything; it only makes us think that we know.
How do I know there is a disaster somewhere?
I do not, because I can only know things near me, and it is not feasible for me to verify every claim in the news; I am merely assuming that the news is honest.
Epistemology is more important than ever in this age of falsehood.

There are some simple experiments that we can carry out to determine the curvature of the Earth.
Reality itself has told us through those experiments that the Earth is not flat; it is up to us to listen to reality or ignore it at our own peril.
We will make costly mistakes if we make antennas and satellites with Flat Earth theory.

The theory makes sense and is a fine scientific theory: it is falsifiable.
What does not make sense to me is the refusal to change one's beliefs despite being otherwise told by reality.

My thought is exactly that of George Box and of Isaac Asimov.

George Box: "All models are wrong but some are useful."[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong]

Isaac Asimov: "When people thought the Earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the Earth was spherical, they were wrong.
But if you think that thinking the Earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the Earth is flat,
then your view is wronger than both of them put together."[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wronger_than_wrong]

Thus, both the Flat Earth theory and the Spherical Earth theory are "wrong", because they are only our descriptions of reality, and not reality itself.
It's just that the Spherical Earth theory is useful in more cases, and Spherical Earth theory is useful in fewer cases.
In software terms, we can think of Flat Earth theory as an "alpha" version of Spherical Earth theory, where the "bugs" are the mismatches with reality.
Updating the "software" fixes some "bugs", but the "software" becomes more complex.

The Flat Earth theory does make testable predictions.
