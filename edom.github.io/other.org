  - What is the difference between variable and parameter?
  - How many parameters do we need to model a system?
  - Discrete Newtonian kinematical model
    - A /system at time \( t \)/ is a set of particles ( { 1, \ldots, n } ).
      - Time is a real number: \( t \in \Real \).
      - The number of particle is constant \( n \in \Nat \).
      - For each particle \( k \):
        - It has /position/ \( x_k \in \Real^3 \).
        - Simplifying assumptions
          - particle
            - It is a point.
              - It doesn't occupy any space.
            - Its mass is not modeled.
          - Time is global and absolute (the same everywhere).
  - Discrete Newtonian dynamical model (N-body problem) extends discrete Newtonian kinematical model.
    - A /system at time \( t \)/ is all that above, plus:
      - For each particle \( k \):
        - It has /mass/ \( m_k \in \Real \).
        - It has /resultant force/ \( F_k \) acting on it.
        - Simplifying assumptions about the particle
          - It is rigid.
            - It doesn't deform.
            - It doesn't break.
          - Its mass is constant.
          - It don't interact with other particles.
            - Particles don't merge or collide.

** Common company wiki fundamental problem
- Employees have no reason to read the wiki.
- It doesn't help them do their jobs.
  - Why should they read it then?
** Library problems
  - In 2018, a lot of human knowledge is still in libraries and not available on the Internet.
    Digital typesetting was invented relatively recently.
    Papers should be scanned and OCR-ed.
    AI can help.
  - Why are there different libraries?
    There should be only one library in the world.
    All library should be the same.
    All library should have the same content.

- Evolutionary ethics
    - Morality is shaped by evolution.
    - We have difficulties defining what is "good", but there are things that we agree are good.
    - Morality is defined by the majority opinion.
    - Humans evolved morality because morality promotes survival.
        - Nature selects moral behavior. There is evolutionary pressure for moral behavior.
            - Sharing foods promotes survival.
            - Sharing knowledge promotes survival.
            - Cooperation promotes survival.
            - Marriage promotes survival?
            - Monogamy promotes survival?
    - The morality of a species is whatever evolved behavior that promotes its survival.

* <2018-09-22> Derita naik Gojek/Gocar
Saya sempat coba Grab dan Gojek.
Saya tidak pakai Grab karena saya benci kode promo.
Akhirnya berlabuh di Gojek.

- Gojek
  - Kadang pengemudi tidak bisa membaca.
    Tiap minggu ada saja pengemudi yang tidak baca catatan, lalu nyasar.
    Sangat buang waktu.
  - Kadang dapat motor Yamaha Aerox.
    - Motor ini tidak aman; pusat massa tinggi, mengurangi kestabilan.
    - Motor ini tidak nyaman; joknya keras, suspensinya keras, menyiksa pantat.
    - Contoh motor yang enak: Honda Scoopy.
      Tampilannya emang culun, tapi jok lebar dan empuk, dan suspensi juga lembut.
      Enak buat pantat.
    - (Saya tidak punya motor.
      Saya bukan fans Yamaha ataupun Honda.
      Saya cuma benci sakit pantat.)
  - Kadang ban kempes.
  - Pernah, jam 17:00, 30 menit gak ada yang ambil.
- Gocar
  - Kadang pengemudi mengantuk, merem melek.
    Mobil ngegas ngerem.
  - Posisi suka ngaco.
    Minta jemput di S Parman, supir di Mal Pondok Indah lah (12 km), di Pejompongan lah (6 km), di Tomang lah (4 km), di sisi jalan yang salah lah (4 km).
  - Kadang di-cancel 5 kali baru dapat.
  - Kadang mobil bau rokok.
- Grabcar
  - <2018-10-25> Saya ditinggal kabur supir grabcar, padahal saya tinggal 5 langkah dari mobil, dan dia belum ada 5 menit menunggu.
- Aplikasi Gojek vs Grab:
  - Grab lebih reliable.
  - Gojek lebih hemat baterai.
- Perasaan saya.
  - Teknologi keduanya shitty, tapi teknologi Grab less shitty daripada teknologi Gojek;
    Grabcar lebih bisa mencari supir yang dekat (500 m, 1 km); Gocar seringkali dapat supir (2 km, bahkan pernah 6 km).
  - Supir Gocar memperlakukan penumpang lebih baik daripada supir Grabcar memperlakukan penumpang.
    Mungkin karena Gojek lebih kejam ke supir.
* Government/state
** Deregulation of USA

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuAg-RaZ4Is][Trump Is 'Destroying' Regulations - YouTube]]

Trump needs a cooperative Congress in order for him to be able to repeal more laws.

** Antonin Scalia: The key to American freedom is the separation of power, not the Bill of Rights.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ggz_gd--UO0

The USSR Constitution guarantees more freedom than the USA Constitution, but the USSR failed to prevent the centralization of power.

Every dictatorship has bill of rights.

North Korea has elections.

** Evolution justifies governments

Evolution suggests that cooperation improves survival (in the long run, of the species, not of an individual).

Evolution suggests that morality improves survival.

Evolution suggests that government improves survival.

What is the state for?
Why do we need government?
To promote the survival of the governed species.

*** Government is not to merely maintain public order.

Public order can be undesirable:

- We don't want a government that oppresses people in order to maintain public order.
- The overthrowing of a tyrant may be a desirable public disorder.

To promote survival of the people? As in evolution?

To better the people?
To impose the morality of the people?
A government reflects the morality of its people.

We must impose our morality on others.
The law imposes the lawmakers' morality on everyone.
It is practically impossible to live without imposing your morality on others.
There is a minimum decency that we expect when we interact with others.

The enforcement of law is an imposition of the morality of the lawmakers (and therefore of the people who elected the lawmakers).

https://www.quora.com/Should-the-law-impose-morality

*** Social apoptosis? Programmed human death?

Some cells must die to better the organism.
Some people should die to better the society?
Programmed cell death ~ programmed human death?

A malfunctioning cell kills itself.
It would be nice if a malfunctioning human could kill himself?

A cell infected by a virus kills itself.
It would be nice if a human infected by ideological virus (mind virus) could kill himself?

How do we know we're infected?

*** Why should our survival be desirable at all?

*** Human rights are legal fiction.

What is real is tolerance.
People let other people live.
If I am still alive, it's because others let me live,
because others tolerate me,
not because I have any rights.

To the pragmatic ontologist, "exist" means "practically exist".

Someone who subscribes to egocentric pragmatic ontology would take the question "What is X?" to mean "What can I use X for? / How can I use X?"

- I can use it, therefore it exists. (Compare: Descartes's "I think, therefore I exist.")

* Defining investing, trading, gambling, betting, wagering, insurance
** Defining gambling
We say that a person /gambles/ iff he bets on an outcome that he doesn't know how to control at all.

Thus, there are two necessary conditions for something to be a gamble:
- There exists a bet.
- There does not exist control.

Other definitions of gambling:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling
- US legal definition https://definitions.uslegal.com/g/gambling/
** How do we know something is not gambling?
*** If it's possible to be skillful, then it's not gambling.
** What
- Investing
- Trading
- Betting
- Random/uncontrollable
- Individual outcome is unpredictable

Can two unskilled people playing chess control the outcome?

Wager and bet are synonyms.

The gambler doesn't have /any/ control over the outcome of a gamble.
How do we know if someone has some control? The ability to affect outcome. By how much? By physical explanation?
Too hard to predict?

The gamblers are gambling, but the casino isn't.
The casino can control the outcome.

Although the individual outcomes are unpredictable, the trend is predictable.

Insurance is reverse gambling, which is also gambling.
It is absurd to buy something that you avoid using.

- "What makes gambling wrong but insurance right?" https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38905963
- https://seekingalpha.com/article/4080260-insurance-gambling-seriously
  - "Insurance is a very specific type of gambling."
  - "Two parties agree on the consideration (by calling that wager a premium instead),
    the type of chance (by using expectations of when the insured might die, for example),
    and a prize (by referring to the winnings as a death benefit)."

Can you insure yourself against loss at the casino?

Is professional poker gambling?
If a skilled player can consistently beat an unskilled player, than the skilled player can control the outcome, and thus the skilled player is not gambling.

If skill (improvement) is possible, then it isn't gambling.

Can you be skilled in throwing dice so that you can consistently beat unskilled people?
Slot machines?
Guessing computer-generated numbers?
What is a possible physical explanation?

How do we argue that binary option is gambling?

** Why the non-oppressed Chinese must help the oppressed Chinese

Because when the oppressed people revolt, the non-oppressed people will be among the victims.

*** Speculations

These are the possible scenarios:
- The oppressed thinks that they are already dead (their lives are worse than death) anyway,
  musters enough strength, revolts, and overthrows the government.
  The non-oppressed (the middle-class) takes collateral damage.
- The government kills off all oppressed people.
  The non-oppressed people lives in their bubble happily ever after.
- The government slowly releases control while trying to save face.

Xi Jinping cannot release control in 2018, because if he releases control, his opponents will pounce on him, reveal all his crimes, and tarnish his name.
Xi Jinping wants to die in good standing, with good reputation; he wants to be remembered as a good person.

I hope that the next bloodshed gives the Chinese people enough reason to limit government power.

You can live a good comfortable life in China as long as you blind yourself from the truth.

You know your country is led by an authoritarian if:
- You can't say the truth there.
- There is someone whom people are too afraid to disagree with, even politely.

We must respect the truth.
The truth doesn't care about us.
People who ignore the truth do so at their own peril.
Ignoring the truth means ignoring some danger;
such ignorance reduces the chance of survival.

** <2018-09-24> Competition is wasteful

Suppose that Company A and Company B both make System S.
They duplicate each other's efforts.
Then Company B loses.
Thus everything B (and all other losers) did is /wasted/.

- If a company doesn't have any competitors, it has little incentive to improve.
  (We assume that companies only improve when they are existentially threatened.)
- How do we make sure that something improves even without competition?
  /Guilds/.

  not an organization that intrinsically wants to maximize profit at all costs.

** Hiring, interviewing, recruiting
*** We should use machine learning to hire?
*** Hiring standards, what to test in work sample tests
**** IOT engineer
Must master some of hardware, software, and business.

- Software
  - C++ smart pointers
- Hardware
  - soldering skills
  - basic understanding of electric circuits
  - designing and making PCBs, including local knowledge of where to buy components and services

What the employer may expect the employee to do:

- design and make systems (hardware and software) with constrained production cost and field operation
- maintain existing programs written in C++/Java (or whatever the employer uses), including documenting software
- travel to maintain remote hardware
*** What is the best predictor?
According to [[http://blog.eskill.com/best-worst-predictors/][eskill.com]]:
- past behavior
- conscientiousness (what is this? how do we test this?)
- cognitive ability

Interviews must be structured.
Unstructured interviews waste time.

[[https://resources.workable.com/blog/conduct-structured-interview][How to conduct a structured interview | Workable]]

We can test skill.

How do we test behavior?

Questions are unreliable.
Actions are reliable.

Where is the research paper?

How does Google hire?

What is the best predictor of on-the-job performance?
How do we interview to best predict on-the-job/post-interview performance?
- the reputation of recent employers (2 years?), and how long the employee worked at those employers
- past experience
- work sample test
- education/university
- IQ
- github
- tricky questions
- school grades
- what else?

Is there evidence-based hiring like evidence-based medicine?

Can we use machine learning to hire people?
[[https://www.criteriacorp.com/resources/whitepaper_tests_versus_humans.php][Can Pre-Employment Tests Predict Employee Success Better than a Human?]]
*** Uncertainty in hiring
In hiring, if a candidate leaves good impressions (not exceptional, but decent nonetheless), but you aren't sure about him, should you just reject him?
Does "maybe" mean "no"?
*** To avoid wasting time, begin with the most selective test.
Begin with the test with the highest failure ratio.
End the interview as soon as the candidates fail the test.
Respect their time and your time.
Don't force them to do what they can't do well.
Don't set them up to fail.
If you aren't going to hire them, don't waste their time.
*** Recruitment pipeline
- Review the resume / curriculum vitae.
*** You know your job ad is wrong when...
You know your job ad is wrong when you have to obviously reject a lot of candidates without thinking.

People don't read the job description.
People only read the job title.

To make sure that people read the job description, you can require that the applicant include a secret word that can only be found in the job ad.
Auto-reject people who don't read the job description.

* Donald Trump, firehose of lies, psychology
** https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/ is a firehose of lies.
- That subreddit uses derogatory/bully language.

    - Read: This subreddit exists to perpetuate lies.

- That subreddit bans fellow Trump supporters who don't lie.

** Nobody should be able to spread lies and go unpunished.
** Do Trump's bankruptcies imply that he is incompetent?
** What is the history of the Republicans? What is the history of the Democrats?
** When humanity is divided, only a catastrophe can reunite us.
- alien invasion
- catastrophic natural disaster

- nuclear plant meltdown
- famine
- any existential threat; a threat to the existence of all of us
* Insane stuffs
** Argument for killing stupid people?
- Premises:
  - People don't change.
    - Stupid is forever.
  - Survival is moral.
    If an action is necessary for survival, then it is moral.
    - Consequence: War for survival is moral.
      If there are only two people left on Earth, and there is only one last drip of water left on Earth,
      then it is moral for those people to go to war (that is, to harm the other) for that last drip of water.
    - Consequence: Retaliation is moral.
      It is moral for X to harm Y if Y harms X first.
  - Stupid people have been harming us.
- Conclusion?
  - It is moral to kill stupid people?
- Weaknesses and problems in the argument:
  - How do we define and determine stupidity?
    We should /not/ define "stupid" as "everyone who doesn't agree with us".
** Analogy: fixing wrong building, fixing wrong children, fixing wrong people?
- The safest action is preemptive strike:
  - When you realize that you built a house wrong, you tear down the house, and rebuild it the right way.
    - Or, you just wait until a natural disaster destroys it, and then rebuild it.
      - Let's hope that you aren't in the building when disaster strikes.
  - When you realize that you raised your child wrong, you kill it (?), and make another child (?).
    - Or, you just wait for karma to kill your child, and have another child.
      - Let's hope that your child doesn't kill you first.
  - If people don't change, then the only way to fix deluded people / persistently misbehaving people is killing them (?).
    - Or, you just wait for a war or disaster.
      - Let's hope that you're not in the shithole when shit happens.
  - We programmers tear down rotten code all the time.
    We rewrite it from scratch.
    Why don't we tear down rotten societies as well?
* Thinking
** Weapons enable oppression.
- Weapons enhance our ability to kill.
  - Weapons enhance our ability to scare.
  - Thus weapons enhance our ability to oppress.
- Order of magnitude of weapon oppression effectiveness
  - With a blade, one person can oppress 1 person.
  - With a pistol, one person can oppress 10 people.
  - With a machine gun, one person can oppress 100 people.
  - With a bomb such as that in Oklahoma city bombing, one person can oppress 1,000 people.
  - With a nuclear bomb such as those dropped by the USA on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War 2, one person can oppress 1,000,000 people.
- Order of magnitude of media deception effectiveness?
  - This is totally baseless.
    How do we estimate this?
  - With hearsay, one person can deceive ten people?
  - With paper, one person can deceive a hundred people?
  - With newspaper or WhatsApp, one person can deceive a million people?
  - With television or Facebook or Google, one person can deceive a hundred million people?
- The only way for the oppressed to fight back is:
  - total guerrilla warfare
  - living near to the oppressor (so that he can't nuke)
  - terrorism
    - Is there really no other way?
      Dialogs?
      Referendums?

  - [A rather low-level approach](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/school/to-infinity-and-beyond/competition-winners/interfacing-with-restful-json-apis).
  - We need an HTTP REST API.
    There are many ways of passing parameters: query string, http header, multipart.

- Ramble

  - Companies must extract value to survive.

    - A profitable company must extract more value
      from its employees than it pays its employees.

      - People create value. People in a company create value. Human labor creates value.
        Companies aren't human. Companies can't work. It's the employees who work.
      - But if the employees weren't in the company, they might create less value.
        The company might be a place where the employees can create more value for society.
