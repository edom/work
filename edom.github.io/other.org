- Linguistics

  - How do we use language?

    - We assume:

      - Every adjective is fuzzy.
      - Truth is a continuum.

- Corruptors and their offsprings have so much money that they don't know what to do with it.
- 2017-07-10

  - Ubuntu crashed without log.

    - Screen turned off suddenly.
    - Keyboard forze.
    - Power button didn't respond even after 4 seconds.
    - The problem turned out to be shitty graphics card connection.

      - Hardware problem, not Ubuntu problem.
      - Probably dust or oxidized connectors.

        - It would be nice if graphics card could be hotswapped though.

          - But do we want to touch a running graphics card?

    - The fix: unplug and plug the card several times.

- How do I find people who care about what I care?
- How do I find people with interests similar to mine?
- How to make money

  - Make hard things easy.

- Should we use holidays to form strategic alliances?
- To form quality relationship, socialize with one person at a time?
- There are only two way of getting rich:

  - create value (make others better)
  - extract value (steal from others, either legally or illegally)

  - What is the difference between variable and parameter?
  - How many parameters do we need to model a system?
  - Discrete Newtonian kinematical model
    - A /system at time \( t \)/ is a set of particles ( { 1, \ldots, n } ).
      - Time is a real number: \( t \in \Real \).
      - The number of particle is constant \( n \in \Nat \).
      - For each particle \( k \):
        - It has /position/ \( x_k \in \Real^3 \).
        - Simplifying assumptions
          - particle
            - It is a point.
              - It doesn't occupy any space.
            - Its mass is not modeled.
          - Time is global and absolute (the same everywhere).
  - Discrete Newtonian dynamical model (N-body problem) extends discrete Newtonian kinematical model.
    - A /system at time \( t \)/ is all that above, plus:
      - For each particle \( k \):
        - It has /mass/ \( m_k \in \Real \).
        - It has /resultant force/ \( F_k \) acting on it.
        - Simplifying assumptions about the particle
          - It is rigid.
            - It doesn't deform.
            - It doesn't break.
          - Its mass is constant.
          - It don't interact with other particles.
            - Particles don't merge or collide.

*** Evolutionary ethics
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_morality
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_ethics
- Evolutionary ethics
    - Morality is shaped by evolution.
    - We have difficulties defining what is "good", but there are things that we agree are good.
    - Morality is defined by the majority opinion.
    - Humans evolved morality because morality promotes survival.
        - Nature selects moral behavior. There is evolutionary pressure for moral behavior.
            - Sharing foods promotes survival.
            - Sharing knowledge promotes survival.
            - Cooperation promotes survival.
            - Marriage promotes survival?
            - Monogamy promotes survival?
    - The morality of a species is whatever evolved behavior that promotes its survival.
** Teaching and learning
  - How to teach history (or anything)
    - Don't memorize things that you can look up on the Internet.
    - Focus on stories, insights, reasons, motivations.
    - Empathize with the subjects.
      Why do they go to war?
  - Learning languages, both human languages and programming languages
    - One learns a language by example sentences.
      One learns a programming language by example programs/snippets.
      - One does not learn a language by memorizing the syntax.
      - One does not learn a language by memorizing the language reference document.

2017-10-09 11:00 +0700 it went down.
They said it would go up on 2017-10-10 23:00 +0700 (24 hour downtime).
2017-10-10 03:23 +0700 it hadn't gone up.
It finally went up, but I didn't note when.

In 2018, we stopped using Fastnet.
We switched to CBN.

Plus:
CBN lebih murah daripada Fastnet.

  - This corrupts Chromium profile.
  - Chromium fails to restore tabs.
    - This is the second time it fails.
  - My response:
    - Discard tabs at the end of browsing.
      - Open Chromium with predefined tabs.
      - This also solves two other problems: tab hoarding and information overload.

I wish we have distributed electricity generation with solar panels and batteries.

** <2018-09-22> Derita naik Gojek/Gocar
Saya sempat coba Grab dan Gojek.
Saya tidak pakai Grab karena saya benci kode promo.
Akhirnya berlabuh di Gojek.

- Gojek
  - Kadang pengemudi tidak bisa membaca.
    Tiap minggu ada saja pengemudi yang tidak baca catatan, lalu nyasar.
    Sangat buang waktu.
  - Kadang dapat motor Yamaha Aerox.
    - Motor ini tidak aman; pusat massa tinggi, mengurangi kestabilan.
    - Motor ini tidak nyaman; joknya keras, suspensinya keras, menyiksa pantat.
    - Contoh motor yang enak: Honda Scoopy.
      Tampilannya emang culun, tapi jok lebar dan empuk, dan suspensi juga lembut.
      Enak buat pantat.
    - (Saya tidak punya motor.
      Saya bukan fans Yamaha ataupun Honda.
      Saya cuma benci sakit pantat.)
  - Kadang ban kempes.
    Kadang motor bocor.
    Kadang ban bocor.
  - Pernah, jam 17:00, 30 menit gak ada yang ambil.
- Gocar
  - Kadang pengemudi mengantuk, merem melek.
    Mobil ngegas ngerem.
  - Posisi suka ngaco.
    Minta jemput di S Parman, supir di Mal Pondok Indah lah (12 km), di Pejompongan lah (6 km), di Tomang lah (4 km), di sisi jalan yang salah lah (4 km).
  - Kadang di-cancel 5 kali baru dapat.
  - Kadang mobil bau rokok.
- Grabbike
  - <2018-10-05> Grab jam 17 sangat shitty.
    Driver tidak bisa dihubungi.
    Dua kali berturut-turut.
- Grabcar
  - <2018-10-25> Saya ditinggal kabur supir grabcar, padahal saya tinggal 5 langkah dari mobil, dan dia belum ada 5 menit menunggu.
- Aplikasi Gojek vs Grab:
  - Grab lebih reliable.
  - Gojek lebih hemat baterai.
- Perasaan saya.
  - Teknologi keduanya shitty, tapi teknologi Grab less shitty daripada teknologi Gojek;
    Grabcar lebih bisa mencari supir yang dekat (500 m, 1 km); Gocar seringkali dapat supir (2 km, bahkan pernah 6 km).
  - Supir Gocar memperlakukan penumpang lebih baik daripada supir Grabcar memperlakukan penumpang.
    Mungkin karena Gojek lebih kejam ke supir.
** Fucking Gmail bullshit I have to cope with

is [[http://www.businessinsider.co.id/google-pulls-mic-drop-minions-april-fools-joke-due-to-complaints-job-losses-2016-4/#.Vv43px_I7Qo][a stupid idea]], and also a harmful one, it turns out.

* Databases? Designing databases?
Datafun[fn::https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC295d3V9gE]
 [fn::http://www.rntz.net/datafun/]

What Datomic brings to businesses[fn::https://medium.com/@val.vvalval/what-datomic-brings-to-businesses-e2238a568e1c]:
Interesting: inherent versioning, internally log-structured, internally append-only.
My only objection: database should be a library, not a separate operating system process.

What[fn::https://augustl.com/blog/2018/datomic_look_at_all_the_things_i_am_not_doing/]

Database design boils down to these questions:
- how do we store (arrange, lay out) data on disk?
- how do we make the database replicate automatically just by adding a node to a cluster?
  etcd?

Why do we store data?
Because we will need it later.
- accounting
- As a person, I don't need convenience store receipts. But a company needs them for accounting.

The stored data has to be findable/discoverable/rediscoverable.
* Philosophy?
** Bertrand Russell
Bertrand Russell - Message To Future Generations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihaB8AFOhZo
** Pragmatic ontology: how pragmatism can help us answer what something is
(Is this really what others mean by "pragmatic ontology"?)

To the pragmatic ontologist, "exist" means "practically exist".

Someone who subscribes to egocentric pragmatic ontology would take the question "What is X?" to mean "What can I use X for? / How can I use X?"

- I can use it, therefore it exists. (Compare: Descartes's "I think, therefore I exist.")
- It affects me, therefore it exists.
** Gaining information by losing data?
(Do I understand what I'm talking about?)

It is possible to gain information while losing data.
We often gain information when we feed data to an irreversible function.
Example:
- array_length
- statistical summarization and interpretation
- modeling
But is that losing data?

Most interesting mappings are irreversible.
Modeling is irreversible mapping.

- Do we have to die?
  Can technology save us?
  Will we reach immortality in this century?
** Sloppy synecdoches: Is a "potato" a plant or a tuber?
A bean is a plant.

Let B be an individual, a bean plant.

Every individual of the species Solanum tuberosum is a plant.

Wrong: Potato is a plant => Every potato is a plant => forall x. potato(x) => plant(x)
A potato plant is a plant.
A potato is not a plant; a potato is a tuber.
Potato the whole plant vs potato the edible tuber.

Of course we can dismiss all this and just be sloppy with synecdoches,
but unclear language breeds unclear thinking.

** If you are going to hire me
- No work for hire.
  I own all my work.

  It's done when I think it's done.
  I don't care about the short-term.
  I don't have a good relationship with time.

- I will not sign any anti-competitive agreements.
  I will not sign non-compete agreements.
  I will not sign non-disclosure agreements.
- I can change my mind at any time.

Perhaps I should hire you, not the other way around?

*** Why not work for/with me?
- I can't guarantee that you will get rich working for/with me.
- I am opinionated and principled. I do things my way.

my accounting principles?

- Keep only one book.
  Don't show different books to different people.
- Accounting records historical truth.
  Don't calculate current market price in accounting reports; mark-to-market belongs in financial statements, not accounting books.
- Don't mix currencies.
- A redenominated currency is a different currency.
- Err on the side of safety.
  Don't count your eggs before they hatch.
  Recognize income as late as possible.
  Recognize expenses as early as possible.

A company with no secrets.
A transparent company.

An economic benevolent dictatorship.

Dictatorship doesn't last.
Systems last.

      If there are only two people left on Earth, and there is only one last drip of water left on Earth,
      then it is moral for those people to go to war (that is, to harm the other) for that last drip of water.
    - Consequence: Retaliation is moral.
      It is moral for X to harm Y if Y harms X first.
  - Stupid people have been harming us.
- Conclusion?
  - It is moral to kill stupid people?
- Weaknesses and problems in the argument:
  - How do we define and determine stupidity?
    We should /not/ define "stupid" as "everyone who doesn't agree with us".
*** Analogy: fixing wrong building, fixing wrong children, fixing wrong people?
- The safest action is preemptive strike:
  - When you realize that you built a house wrong, you tear down the house, and rebuild it the right way.
    - Or, you just wait until a natural disaster destroys it, and then rebuild it.
      - Let's hope that you aren't in the building when disaster strikes.
  - When you realize that you raised your child wrong, you kill it (?), and make another child (?).
    - Or, you just wait for karma to kill your child, and have another child.
      - Let's hope that your child doesn't kill you first.
  - If people don't change, then the only way to fix deluded people / persistently misbehaving people is killing them (?).
    - Or, you just wait for a war or disaster.
      - Let's hope that you're not in the shithole when shit happens.
  - We programmers tear down rotten code all the time.
    We rewrite it from scratch.
    Why don't we tear down rotten societies as well?
** "English" names
Scarface, Boaty McBoatface
Sir Lancelot, Sir Chirpsalot (chirps a lot), Sir Changealot (change a lot)
** Name-calling
A name-calling person is a insecure person who has run out of rational arguments.
** Terror, fear, power?
Engels:
"Terror consists mostly of useless cruelties perpetrated by frightened people in order to reassure themselves."
** Statistics, smoking, mindfulness
Seeing statistics worries me.
Most researchers don't understand statistics.
For example, I don't need statistics to know that smoking is bad; it's obvious.
It smells bad.
It makes me dizzy.

I guess people smoke because they have peer pressure, they have a weird sense of "cool", and they are too lazy to think for themselves.

Smoking always tastes bad.
Thus it is the rationalization that makes smokers tough it out.

How to stop smoking (Does it work?)

Remember when you first smoke cigarettes.
This is my guess.
It tastes bitter.
You cough.
Your eyes water.
It hurts.
But you tough it out.
You fear that your friends will leave you if you don't smoke.

I want you to taste every cigarette in the same way you tasted your first cigarette.
It's always the first time.
Feel the unpleasant bitter taste.
** Code of conduct
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't do things that you don't want to be done to you.
- Talk in cyberspace as you talk in meatspace.
  If you won't say it to someone you are talking with, don't write it on the Internet.

People nowadays get offended too easily.
It is possible to disagree without fighting.

What is an asshole?
If many people in the same room hate you, then maybe you are an asshole.

Swearwords show passion.
But if you use swearwords too often, they lose their meaning and impact.

Maybe sprinkle some smilies when you use swearwords.

But swearwords don't add meaning?
** Climate change
Climate change (increasing temperature and carbon dioxide) is real, but we don't agree about whether it's harmful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3hHi4sylxE
** Things I learned the hard way
*** <2018-10-08> While a person is on a motorcycle (be it driving or not driving), he must secure his chattels, and not place them in shirt pockets, in order to prevent the chattels from falling to the road (therefore being lost or broken).
- Secure the chattels:
  - Put it in a /totally closed compartment/ in a bag, not in a pocket on the bag.
  - Grip the chattels.
- Triggers:
  - Eyeglasses fell from shirt pocket to the road, and were run over by the motorcycle behind.
  - A few months ago, a hairband fell from bag pocket to the road; it was lost.
  - Shit happened. Twice.
** Finding bottleneck?
*** what
Make sure that the bottleneck is not in the kernel
netstat | grep
Check the number of connections
Expected jmeter number of connections

Make sure that jmeter is properly configured

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42311414/iperf3-windows-bandwidth-is-much-slower-than-linux
iperf
sudo apt-get install iperf
Run this on PHP machine: iperf -s
Let SERVER be the IP address of the PHP machine.
Run this on JMeter machine: iperf -c SERVER

CPU tidak mentok, RAM tidak mentok, berarti ada beberapa kemungkinan:
- bottleneck di network,
- CPU di-throttle oleh docker/cgroup,
- bottleneck di disk seek rate (unnecessary SQL transaction),
- bottleneck di disk transfer rate.

If 1 request takes 1 KB, then 10000 request/second translates to 10 MB/s, which is enough to saturate a 100 Mbps Ethernet interface.

check disk queue depth dengan top (average load)
iotop

https://serverfault.com/questions/665799/whats-the-technique-to-find-out-bottleneck/665831
- atop for cpu & ram
- iotop for disk
- iftop for network

Disable swap, but be careful to avoid running out of memory.

Pastikan bottleneck bukan di mesin JMeter (terutama di network interface-nya). Apakah mesin JMeter sudah dipisah dari mesin PHP?

Linux kernel limit: number of open files, maximum number of open sockets.

Docker bisa mengurangi performance. Kalau tidak pakai Docker, apa bisa lebih cepat?
Ganti 20 docker instance php-fpm dengan 1 php-fpm dengan 20 children.

*** Measuring things to find bottlenecks (Linux, TCP, HTTP, network, CPU, disk, etc.)
- How many empty TCP connections per second can a TCP endpoint accept?
  We don't want to measure transfer rate.
  We want to measure kernel bookkeeping overhead.
  - These can't do that:
    - iperf
  - Can these do that?

- How many HTTP requests can it handle? Use ApacheBench. =sudo apt-get install apache2-utils=.
- How do we reduce the worst-case response time under high load?
- Is the Linux process scheduler fair?
- Is the Linux process scheduler time complexity O(1)?

- Which is better, select or epoll?
**** Linux TCP TIME_WAIT exhaustion on busy server
- What are my options?
  - Assign more IP addresses.
  - Geographically distribute the application.
    Procure edge servers closer to the clients.
    But you can't do this if you are not a CDN or ISP.
  - Reduce the TIME_WAIT MSL (maximum segment lifetime)
    - http://www.lognormal.com/blog/2012/09/27/linux-tcpip-tuning/
    - This makes TCP incorrect, but in the case of a load balancer, the probability of the incorrectness is negligible (unless it's an attack, or it's behind a NAT).
    - =net.ipv4.netfilter.ip_conntrack_tcp_timeout_time_wait = 1=

** Aircraft crashes
Causal chain:
- Boeing 737 MAX crashes two times in less than a year.
  - MCAS (Manuvering Characteristic Augmentation System) fights the pilot.
    - MCAS is a software workaround for a hardware flaw (the aircraft's tendency to pitch up and stall when engine power is increased).
      - The hardware flaw is an economic workaround for a strategic flaw?
        - Boeing wants to avoid retraining costs.
        - Boeing sticked to the 737 design for too long?
          - Boeing is averse to giant-leap innovations?
          - Economic competition too aggressive?

** Organizing knowledge
*** what
- Knowledge should be ordered descending by importance, from the most important?
- Knowledge should be ordered ascending by verifiability, from the easiest to verify?
- Knowledge should be grouped by usefulness?

  - If both Y and Z are useful to X, then Y and Z should be put together.

- Why does someone need to know something?

  - What is all the related things that he also needs to know?

- others

  - [[https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog882/l3_p3.html][Kant's Three Ways of Ordering Knowledge]]

- In what sequence should we present knowledge for fastest learning?
- Example of primitive life (but not survivalism?)

  - [[https://www.youtube.com/user/laws507/videos][YT:Primitive Life]]

- information organization

  - An information is a sentence, a paragraph, a picture, or anything that helps us accomplish something.

    - Here "information" is a countable noun.

  - Informations should be grouped by the task it helps us accomplish.

    - Every task T requires a set of informations, which should be put together in one place.
    - If doing task T requires informations J and K, then J and K should be grouped together.
    - Duplication problem.

      - Suppose: both task T and task U requires information J.
      - Where should J be put?

  - The value of information J should be measured by the ratio V/E, where V is the value of the task that J helps us accomplish, and E is our effort for obtaining J.
  - Example of combinatorial explosion of categories.

    - Which should a red car be grouped together with: a red hat or a blue car?

      - Which should a big old man be grouped together with: a big old woman, a big young man, or a small old man?

- The information organization of this wiki

  - At first I tried grouping by topic.
  - Then I asked myself, "Why am I collecting this information?"
  - Then I tried grouping by project (goals).
  - I switched from lookup-oriented knowledge organization (organize knowledge for refindability (fast lookup))
    to task-oriented (goal-oriented) knowledge organization (organize knowledge by the tasks that require the knowledge).

- Can machine organize information for us?
  Can machine cluster documents by the task they help accomplish?

** Magick
*** Wanted: replicable magick experiments
- Notes?

  - The presence of the experimenter affects the result?
  - The experiments may need to be repeated many times?

- Experiment ideas, ordered from the easiest to repeat:

  - Extrasensory perception

    - Astral projection

      1. Get a person (A) who can astral-project.
      2. Generate a bit X.
      3. Ask A about X.

    - Dream precognition

      - Telepathy

        1. Get two telepathic people A and B. (If you are telepathic yourself, you can be any one of them.)
        2. Generate a bit X (0 or 1) that only you and A know.
        3. Let A telepathically tell X to B. (Take care to isolate each of you to avoid sensory leakage.)
        4. Ask B about X.

    - Spirit possession

      - Procedure:

        1. Get two mediums A and B. (If you are a medium yourself, you can be A.)
        2. Get A to summon a spirit S.
        3. Generate a bit X (0 or 1) that only you and A know.
        4. Let A tell X to S.
        5. Get S into B. (This needs more detail.)
        6. Ask the S-possessed B about X.
           If he/she consistently knows, we may have a support for dualism.
        7. Get S out of B.

      - If the experiment result is promising,
        we can test the spirit's working memory capacity
        by replacing the bit X with a string, a number, a sentence, or whatever longer.
        The only important constraint is that you need to pick an X
        that is easy to remember but hard to guess.
      - Problems:

        1. Mediation may be tiring? (Can get another medium?)
        2. Spirits may refuse to cooperate? (Can get another spirit?)

  - Joint micropsychokinesis

    - What if many people try to influence a RNG at once?
      So far experiments one person influences a RNG at a time.
      Does the effect add up?

      - Is there even any effect at all?

- We might dismiss one person for hallucinating.
  Two unrelated honest people corroborating each other are less likely to be hallucinating.
  The more people say the same thing, the more serious the claim is.
  Not necessarily more true, but surely more serious.
  Most people are not pathological liars.

** Maximizing lithium-ion battery life
- https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries
  - "Exposing the battery to high temperature and dwelling in a full state-of-charge for an extended time can be more stressful than cycling."
  - "In terms of longevity, the optimal charge voltage is 3.92V/cell."
  - "Every 70mV drop in charge voltage lowers the usable capacity by about 10%."
  - "Partial charging negates the benefit of Li-ion in terms of high specific energy."
  - "Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, reports that using a reduced charge level of 50% SOC increases the lifetime expectancy of the vehicle Li-ion battery by 44–130%."
  - "For safety reasons, many lithium-ions cannot exceed 4.20V/cell."
  - "Industrial devices, such as the EV, typically limit the charge to 85% and discharge to 25% to prolong battery life."
    - "Why Mobile Phone Batteries do not last as long as an EV Battery" https://batteryuniversity.com/index.php/learn/article/why_mobile_phone_batteries_do_not_last_as_long_as_an_ev_battery
  - "The question is asked, “Should I disconnect my laptop from the power grid when not in use?”
    Under normal circumstances this should not be necessary because charging stops when the Li-ion battery is full.
    A topping charge is only applied when the battery voltage drops to a certain level.
    Most users do not remove the AC power, and this practice is safe."
    - "Always keep the airflow unobstructed when running electric devices with air-cooling on a bed or pillow."
** Causal inference and machine learning
- Judea Pearl 2018 article "Theoretical Impediments to Machine Learning With Seven Sparks from the Causal Revolution" summarizes
seven tasks that causal modeling can do but current machine learning can't.

** Mathematics
- Writing mathematics
  - 1989, article, "Mathematical writing", Donald E. Knuth, Tracy Larrabee, and Paul M. Roberts, [pdf](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf)
    - "Many readers will skim over formulas on their first reading of your exposition.
      Therefore, your sentences should flow smoothly when all but the simplest formulas are replaced by 'blah' or some other grunting noise. (p. 3)
- Reference articles
  - Which point of view should we use?
    - We can see a function as a special kind of relation.
    - We can see a relation from \( A \) to \( B \) as a function from \( A \) to \( 2^B \).
      - Every binary relation \((A,B,r)\) is a function \((A,2^B,f)\)
        where \(f(x) = \{ y ~\|~ r(x,y) \}\).
    - Which is more primitive: function or relation?
*** Math, learning, and brain?
https://dyske.com/paper/825
"When I was in 7th grade, my math teacher answered an obvious but difficult question:
Why do we have to study advanced math, if we are never going to use it in our adult lives?
He said it’s because the same parts of our brains used for math can be used for many other things in life.
With this short explanation, he utterly convinced me the importance of studying math, and of any other subjects for that matter."

- GIF videos must have controls.
- Google should penalize (push down) Pinterest from image search.

**** Using chat such as IRC/Slack
- I find that most channels are idle.
- There are two kinds of channels: temporary and permanent.
  - Temporary channel is functional. It gathers people for a task/project.
  - Permanent channel is structural. It gathers people in the same tribe/department/structure.

**** <2018-08-29> IQ and jobs
  Although I'm happy to be proven wrong,
  I believe that a minimum IQ of 120 is necessary but not sufficient for software engineering (cooperativeness is also required).
  It seems IQ tests are inaccurate for high IQs above 130.

    - The OP doesn't sound like his IQ is 89.
  - Higher IQ means faster learning, and that's all.
  - To each according to their ability.
    Society needs low IQ people.
    Some jobs fit low IQ people.
    These jobs are equally honorable as high IQ jobs are.
    Low IQ isn't an insult.
    Everyone is different.

The biggest problem of Cantonese:
it doesn't have /standard/ romanization like Hanyu Pinyin, does it?
Cantonese has three: Jyutping Romanization, Yale Romanization, and Cantonese Pinyin.
It unnecessarily fragments learning resources.

***** Some Indonesian vernaculars
Spoken Indonesian is wildly different from written Indonesian and news Indonesian.
On the street, nobody speak like news anchors.
****** Dong, kek
"Gitu dong!" (with emphasis on tu)
"Nah, gitu dong!"
"Gitu kek dari tadi!"
That's what I wanted you to do!
If only you had shut up and done that earlier,
we wouldn't have had to fight.

"Iiiih diem dong!"
(Can't you shut up!?)

"Ga bisa gitu dong!"
"Enak aja lu!"
"Apaan!?"
"Dari mana!?"
"Atas dasar apa!?"
(Typical response to outrage-inducing unfairness, injustice, or absurdity.
What the hell?
You can't do that!)
****** Doang, sih, aja
"Gitu doang?"
(Is that all? Is that all you got?)

"Segitu doang kemampuanlu? Cupu banget sih lu!"
(Is that all you got? You piece of shit!)

"Kenapa sih tiap kali gua datang, ada aja masalah..."
(I'm dying to know why there is always a problem every time I come.)

"Gitu doang ngambek"
"Gitu aja marah"
(Why the hell are you angry for such trivial thing?)

"Coba diem dulu deh!!"
Can't you shut up for a while?

"Eh ini enak. Cobain deh..."
This is delicious. Here, try some!

"Iya aja deh"
"Apa katalu dah"
(Whatever you say.)

"Masih aja!"
(Why the hell are you still doing this?
Haven't I told you to stop already?)

"Ini aja?" (Is this everything?)
"Iya ini aja"
"Iya ini doang" (Yes, it's everything.)
****** Deh
"Eh iya deh."
(Oops, I was wrong.)
(Oops, I just remembered.)

"Iya maaf deh."
(Sorry. Whatever. Are you happy now?)
****** Kok
"Kok lu masih idup?"
(Why the hell are you still alive?)

"Kok lu di sini?"
"Kok lu di sini sih?"
(Why are you here? You aren't supposed to be here.)

"Udah dikerjain kok PR-nya Ma."
(What the hell are you accusing me for Mum?
I have done my homework, you know.)

A: "Eh ini kok gini? dapet dari mana?"
(Huh? Why is this? Where does this come from?)
B: "Ya iya dong. Masa gini aja lu ga ngerti?"
(I'm getting impatient.
Isn't it obvious?
You can't understand something this simple?)

"Gitu aja kok repot" (trademark alm. Gus Dur)
"Why so much hassle over such small matter?"
(I think Joker's (as played by Heath Ledger) "Why so serious?" also fits this somewhat.)
****** Lah, lho or loh
"Ya begitulah"
(More or less that's the case.)

"Ya begitulah"
(a vague and rather polite response that does not mean anything;
this avoids making the other party think you are ignoring him/her)

"Ya begitulah"
"Ya begitulah... lu tau sendiri kan"
"Mau gimana lagi?"
仕方ない
(Nothing can be done about it; What else can be done?)

"Lho kok masih di sini?"
(Why the hell are you still here?)

"Lho kok belum dikerjain?"
(Why the hell haven't you done this?)

"Iya lho"
"Bener lho"
(I'm serious. I'm not lying.)

"Lho lho lho"
(Wait, what?)

"Gue gitu loh"
(Of course I can do that. I'm the greatest.)
****** Toh
"Oh gitu toh"
そうですか。
なるほど。
I see.

***** How does swapping the subject and the predicate changes the meaning of a copular sentence (a sentence whose verb is the copula)? Subject-predicate asymmetry?
We consider sentences of these forms: "X is Y" and "Y is X", where each of X and Y is a noun phrase.

We are interested in how swapping X and Y changes the meaning of the sentence.

- John is the culprit.
- The culprit is John.

- Mark Twain is Samuel Langhorne Clemens.
- Samuel Langhorne Clemens is Mark Twain.

*** Learning to play mahjong
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: learning-to-play-mahjong
  :END:

The variant discussed here is classic Chinese mahjong.

**** Basic facts
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: basic-facts
   :END:

There are 136 mahjong tiles,
of which 52 are dealed to the players.
The remaining 84 forms the wall.
Thus, in a play, you only get at most 21 chances to change your hand,
that is 84 divided by 4 (the number of players).

If each player takes 15 seconds, then a hand
will take at most 4 x 15 x 21 = 1,260 seconds (21 minutes).

There are 136 tiles (not including 4 flower tiles and 4 season tiles):

There are 3 suits (bams, dots, and chars). Each suit has 9 classes. Each number has 4 instances. Thus each suit has 36 tiles. Thus there are 108 suit tiles.

There are 7 honors (4 winds and 3 dragons). Each honor has 4 instances. Thus there are 28 honor tiles.

There are 27 suit classes and 7 honor classes, giving a total of 34 classes.

Each tile class has 4 instances.

Each tile is equally probable to be drawn.

The probability of picking a tile class is 4/136. The odds of picking a tile class is 4:132.

**** Number of chows, pungs, and kongs
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: number-of-chows-pungs-and-kongs
   :END:

The probability of drawing a pung:
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 * 2/134 = 1/3,015 (odd of 1 : 3,014, approx 1 : 3,000)

Each suit has 7 unique chows: 123, 234, 345, 456, 567, 678, 789.
There are 3 suits, so there are 21 unique chows.
Each tile has 4 instances.
Each chow has 4^3 instances.
The probability of drawing a chow: 21 * 4^3 / (136 * 135 * 134) = 28 / 51,255
(odd of 1 : 51,227, approx 1 : 51,000).

Pung is more likely than chow. Is this a calculation mistake?

The probability of drawing a kong (four identical tiles):
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 * 2/134 * 1/133 = 1/400,995 (odd of 1 : 400,994, approx 1 : 401,000)

The probability of drawing a pair:
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 = 1/45 (odd of 1 : 44)

The probability of drawing two tiles having the same class:
4/136 * 3/135 = 1/1,530 (odd of 1 : 1,529)

The probability of drawing two tiles having the same suit (3 suits):
3 * 36/136 * 35/135 = 7/34 (odd of 7 : 27, approx 1 : 4)

The probability of drawing a chow:
The probability of drawing n, n+1, n+2 unordered of the same suit, for n in 1 to 7:

3! * 3 * 7 * 4/136 * 4/135 * 4/134 = 56/17,085 (odd of 56 : 17,029, about 1 : 304)

The probability of drawing a pair, given that one tile has been drawn by another player:

Let each player draw exactly one tile. The probability of four players drawing the same tile:
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 * 2/134 * 1/133 = the probability of drawing a kong

*** Making a search engine?
- Stop words (word ignore list) deal with index construction, not about query comprehension.
  The search may ignore stop words when crawling, but it should not ignore stop words in queries.

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words][WP:Stop words]]
  - query comprehension

    - Every word changes the intention/meaning of the query.
    - We need contextual search engine.

      - What operation does the RWI (reverse word index) speed up?

        - RWI is a hash table that maps a word to a URL.
          An entry (k,v) in the RWI means that the word k is found in the document at the URL v.
        - What is the relationship between RWI and inverted index?

          - An RWI is an inverted index.
          - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index][WP:Inverted index]]

    - YaCy doesn't have DHT (distributed hash table) routing.
      What does that mean?
      Why would one want DHT routing?
      Why would DHT imply routing?

    - Setting up YaCy

      - Clone YaCy GitHub
      - Prepare isolation

        - =sudo adduser --system --group yacy=
        - =sudo adduser $SUDO_USER yacy=, replace =$SUDO_USER= with your non-yacy user
        - =sudo chown -R yacy:yacy=

      - Build YaCy

        - =sudo -u yacy -H /bin/bash= for shell
        - In that shell:

          - =ant clean all=

      - Start YaCy

        - Still in the yacy shell:

          - =./startYACY.sh -f= to start YaCy in foreground

      - Use YaCy

        - Open [[http://localhost:8090/]]

      - Can we make it easier to setup YaCy peer network?

        - My scenario is typical:

          - I'm behind two layers of NAT: my ISP's router, and my USB-tethered Android phone.
          - Overlay network? VPN? Hosting on cloud?

      - Should we host YaCy on GCP (Google Cloud Platform)?
        It's cheap (USD 4.28 per month in us-west-1/us-central-1/us-east-1? Really? What about network data transfer costs into?).
        It might be even cheaper (GCP free tier).

        - Even cheaper: Run YaCy on GCE preemptible instances?
        - alternative: DigitalOcean? https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/

    - Problems

      - YaCy, Solr, who knows what, sometimes runs out of memory.
        How come?
      - Does YaCy deal with stemming and synonyms?

    - How does YaCy use Solr?

**** Solving the Israel-Palestine problem
- I propose this for the Israel-Palestine problem:

  - Country

    - Establish a new country (say "Ispal"), merging Israel and Palestine.

  - Government

    - Everyone in the Israeli government is in the Ispalian government.
    - Everyone in the Palestinian government is in the Ispalian government.

  - Land

    - The land of Ispal is the land of Israel plus the land of Palestine.

  - Citizen

    - Every Israeli is an Ispalian.
    - Every Palestinian is an Ispalian.

  - Law

    - Every Ispalian is equal before the law.

  - Why this might not be accepted

    - Idealism, fanaticism, narrow-mindedness, intolerance, ignorance of history, mixing religion and politics

**** violin
This is my study notes, observations, and conclusions.
This is a bit disorganized.

I play the violin without chin rest and shoulder rest.
***** The right pinky
The right pinky is for playing softly:
tilt the bow very slightly by pressing down the pinky (with the thumb as the fulcrum).
XXX: Is it by flexing the pinky or by supinating the hand?

Playing softly is harder than playing loudly.
Playing softly also uses more tension than playing loudly.
***** Squeaking
Each bow speed has a range of pressure that will make a good sound.
Less bow speed needs less pressure.
The symptom of too much pressure for a bow speed is squeaking;
increase the bow speed, or decrease the bow pressure, or both.

Decrease the bow pressure by pressing the end of the bow with the right pinky,
with the thumb as the fulcrum.
***** Playing open strings
Open strings, especially the A and E strings,
sound brighter than stopped strings,
so open strings will be perceived as louder
even though the bow speed and pressure stay the same.
In order to play scales with even dynamics,
we can avoid open strings,
or we can bow the open strings more softly
with reduced pressure and speed.

Also, we can play the D string nearer to the bridge to brighten it,
and the A string nearer to the fingerboard to darken it,
to make the change from the D to the A string smoother.
***** Idea for group practice
Learning Kreutzer etudes together?
***** Bouncing bows
The hairs act as a spring.

Vertical component of stick-slip.

Act as torque with the right thumb as the fulcrum.

*** <2016-03-22> The reason for the name spacetimecat.com
In jazz-speak, a /cat/ is a jazz musician, and
I'm a jazz musician traveling through spacetime;
hence the name /spacetime cat/.

However, most importantly, the domain is a dot-com,
and it was available, untouched by rent-seeking domain speculators.

Another reason is that the name isn't tied to shady stuffs
and doesn't have unwanted connotations.
A quick google shows that the worst result
for 'spacetime cat' is cat pictures,
which should be pretty safe for everyone
except perhaps a few extreme cat haters.

It's also nice that the name
isn't too hard to remember or spell,
but it's hard to get it wrong.

Hence I bought spacetimecat.com.

  - To polarize someone is to make him more confident (about a belief).
  - Confirmation bias: People hear what they want to hear.

    - People filter incoming information.
    - People bend incoming information to conform with their preexisting beliefs.
    - Agreements polarize people, but disagreements don't depolarize people.
    - Information agreeing with preexisting belief polarize the believer.

  - To temporarily defuse your enemy's hatred of you, find another enemy that is common to both of you.

    - These happens in quick succession:
      Coworker A offended me.
      Then coworker B came and offended A in front of me.
      Then I offend coworker B in front of A.
      Then I can feel some agreement with coworker A.

  - The perception of having a common enemy unites people, even if the enemy is fake.

    - This has a concrete recommendations for countering the firehose of falsehood.

  - Trump and Putin use "firehose of falsehood" to assert power, in the same way school bullies do.
  - The only way to take power from them is to dismiss them.
    Media should stop giving them a platform.
    We should refuse to hear them.
    We should not fact-check, because by fact-checking we affirm that they have power.
    We should simply dismiss everything they say.
    Their competitors should counter-flood the media with their own firehoses.
  - I'm sure Trump and Putin are not the only people using that technique.
    I suspect that PKS may be using that technique in mosques in West Java.

** Navigating social relationships?
*** Friendship
**** Abstract
Your friends are those who sacrifice for you.
The greater the sacrifice,
the greater the friendship.
How do we measure a sacrifice?
**** Measurement in theory
We define $F(A,B)$ (the /friendship measure from A to B/)
as how much sacrifice that A is willing to make for B.

(Is the direction correct? Is that backwards?)

Thus measuring friendship boils down to valuating sacrifices.

$F(A,B)$ can be approximated by an equivalent amount of money.
**** Measurement in practice
Foot-in-the-door:
let A ask B to make bigger and bigger sacrifices until B refuses.
Then we have found $F(A,B)$.

Door-in-the-face:
let A ask B to make a sacrifice so big that B refuses,
and then let A ask B to make smaller and smaller sacrifices until B accepts.
Then we have found $F(A,B)$.

Those results may differ, but $F(A,B)$ should lie somewhere between those two points.
We can also average them, take the maximum, take the minimum,
use interval arithmetics,
or describe the result using a statistical distribution, for example.
**** Properties
Friendship is circumstantial:
$F(A,B)$ changes over time.

Friendship is usually asymmetric:
$F(A,B) \neq F(B,A)$.
**** Questions
What is self-friendship?
What is $F(A,A)$?
How much is one willing to sacrifice for oneself?
Does this question even make sense?

*** Defining "boss"
- What is a boss?

  1. X is a /boss/ of Y iff X can affect Y's salary, even if X does it indirectly.
  2. X is a /strong boss/ of Y iff X has the authority to change Y's salary.
  3. X is a /weak boss/ of Y iff X is a boss, but not a strong boss, of Y.

- Example:

  - Everyone who can fire you is your strong boss.
  - Everyone who can get you fired (complain to someone who can fire you) is your weak boss.

- The stronger a boss is, the more seriously you should treat him/her.
- Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
**** Another definition, based on fear: X is a boss of Y if Y fears X.
*** Happiness
Happiness = Reality - Expectation.

To be more happy, raise reality, lower expectation, or do both.

Pain also reduces happiness.

Money cannot buy happiness,
but it can buys things that will make you happier.

Money helps, but after you have enough to make your life comfortable,
adding money doesn't add happiness.
** Fear explains everything.
There are only two ways to make people do something:
- Make them want it.
- Make them fear the consequences of not doing it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_appeal
*** Explaining love/attachment as fear of loss...
*** Intrinsic motivation to do X is fear of the consequences of not doing X.
*** To want X is to fear not getting X.
*** We eat because we fear death. We eat because we fear regretting not tasting the delicious-looking food.
*** It is the terrorists/extremists who are afraid of us, in the same way a cornered rat biting us is afraid of us?

If I could solve the libertarian children problem, I would be a libertarian by now.

Is antinatalism against nature?
Yes, if humans have innate drive to breed (to have have an offspring).
No, if humans have innate drive to fuck only (to satisfy the genitals, not including breeding).

I'm more inclined toward survivalism than antinatalism.

Antinatalism is noble but impractical.
The reality is that billions of low-IQ people are going to fuck and breed anyway,
producing low-IQ children who never question anything, repeating the stupidity of their parents, perpetuating the cycle.
But this may be practical in the future:
Inconspicuous forced mass sterilization!
Airborne human-sterilizing nanobots!
Human-sterilizing viruses!
Infertility-causing foods!

** Anarchism?
1995 book "What Is Anarchism? An Introduction"
https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/donald-rooum-and-freedom-press-ed-what-is-anarchism-an-introduction
*** Letter to anarchists: Say "self-governance" instead of "anarchism"; focus on making what you want, not on avoiding what you hate
Your goal is noble, but, for your message to be acceptable by the people,
you must use the word "self-governance" instead of "anarchy".
No need to change anything else, just replace all occurrences of "anarchy" with "self-governance".
This will make your speeches and writings infinitely more acceptable
to the uneducated people that you need.
No more wasting time explaining what "anarchy" really is.

It does not benefit you to use a word that has been redefined by everyone else.
Your meaning of "anarchy" dates back to Proudhon's 1840 treatise "What is property?"
It's 2018, almost 200 years since Proudhon,
and the topmost Google search result for "anarchy" today
is "a state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority".
You see, even the dictionaries and the Internet are conspiring against you.
Nobody wins a fight against the Internet.
You need a new word.

The word "anarchy" focuses on the absence of a ruler.
It gives the impression that you are a belligerent forever
plotting a coup d'etat against your nemesis the government.
You don't want that.
You want to maximize everyone's freedom,
and you want people to associate voluntarily,
which is to say that they self-govern.
The word "self-governance" gives the impression that you are
a youthful progressive bunch of people
with positive success mindset brimming with can-do attitude.
It sounds like bullshit, but flowery bullshit sells better than ugly truth.

It's unfortunate that words change meanings, but language changes with the people who speak it.
You won't see any progress until you change the word you use to spread your message.

The word "anarchy" is, in today's context, bad for marketing your cause.

Thus, from now on, say and write "self-governance" instead of "anarchy".

Evolution suggests that morality improves survival.

Evolution suggests that government improves survival.

What is the state for?
Why do we need government?
To promote the survival of the governed species.

**** Government is not to merely maintain public order.

Public order can be undesirable:

- We don't want a government that oppresses people in order to maintain public order.
- The overthrowing of a tyrant may be a desirable public disorder.

To promote survival of the people? As in evolution?

To better the people?
To impose the morality of the people?
A government reflects the morality of its people.

We must impose our morality on others.
The law imposes the lawmakers' morality on everyone.
It is practically impossible to live without imposing your morality on others.
There is a minimum decency that we expect when we interact with others.

The enforcement of law is an imposition of the morality of the lawmakers (and therefore of the people who elected the lawmakers).

Answer them honestly in your mind.
You can choose to keep your answers to yourself,
so please be completely honest to yourself.

Please do not feel stupid.
Honesty is not stupidity.
Not being able to answer a question does not imply stupidity.

If you are a religious person and you answer the questions seriously,
then these are some possible outcomes:

1. You ignore these questions or refuse to answer them.
   If you think I'm just trying to confuse you,
   please know that I respect your time,
   and I'm trying to help you.
   The questions are hard because they are serious questions, not riddles.
   I'm sorry if what I thought would be good turns out to be bad for you.
2. You invent new rationalizations
   (
   e.g. the author is committing a logical fallacy,
   all good people can go to heaven regardless of their religion,
   all religions basically teach good things,
   my religion might not be the best but it's the one I'm most familiar with,

*** A fiction of Ali and Bob
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: a-fiction-of-ali-and-bob

Ali is a good Muslim.
Bob is a good Christian.
They are good friends.

But then Ali reads [[http://quran.com/74/42-47][Quran 74:42-47]],
and Bob reads [[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16-20&version=NIV][John 3:16-20]].

Each of them wants to go to their respective heaven,
and as good friends, each of them also wants the best for the other,
which is for the other to go to heaven,
but they aren't sure whose heaven:
Ali's holy book implies that Bob is going to the Islamic hell,
and Bob's holy book implies that Ali is going to the Christian hell.

They can't bear the dissonance, but don't want to live as enemies either,
and they don't want to assume that their friend is wrong,
for such assumption would justify their converting their friend,
and they think the other won't like any proselytizing,
because they don't like being proselytized themselves,
and they won't do unto others what they don't want others to do unto them.
They don't want to reduce their friendship into mere tolerance;
thus they throw away their holy books and religions,
and they stay good friends until their death,
while still believing in a higher power.

Therefore, it cannot be the case that both R1 and R2 are true.

Governments shouldn't guarantee bank deposits.
Governments should not encourage people to save too much money at banks.
Governments should encourage trade.

Employers love immigration.
Immigration makes cheap workers.
Illegal immigrants are even cheaper.

The pro-immigration people hide that desire behind pretend humanitarianism.
They don't care about cultural stability, as they live in their safe enclaves, protected by the government they bribe, far away from where immigrants live.

*** Minimum wage hurts the very people it is supposed to protect.
First, pandering politicians raise minimum wage.

Then, companies scramble to avoid bankruptcy.
A company has several options:
- Do nothing; keep the workers, bear the cost. (Do you think the company will happily accept the reduced profit, if it still profits at all?)
- Raise prices, passing costs to buyers. (But then the buyers will buy less. Law of supply and demand.)
- Cut costs by reducing quality. (But will the buyers still buy?)
- Train the workers to make them more productive. (But how far can we train people?)
- Fire the workers, move to somewhere with cheaper workers.
- Fire the workers, buy robots.

https://www.minimumwage.com/

Political propaganda can't change the basic economic law of supply and demand.
This law is more fundamental than the politician-made laws.
Political fantasy can't change economic reality.
Ignore reality at your own peril.

I think workers should negotiate with their employers, and there is no need to involve government.

** <2018-09-24> Competition is wasteful
Suppose that Company A and Company B both make System S.
They duplicate each other's efforts.
Then Company B loses.
Thus everything B (and all other losers) did is /wasted/.

- If a company doesn't have any competitors, it has little incentive to improve.
  (We assume that companies only improve when they are existentially threatened.)
- How do we make sure that something improves even without competition?
  /Guilds/.
  An organization that /intrinsically/ wants to improve (while still profiting),
  not an organization that intrinsically wants to maximize profit at all costs.

These are the possible scenarios:
- The oppressed thinks that they are already dead (their lives are worse than death) anyway,
  musters enough strength, revolts, and overthrows the government.
  The non-oppressed (the middle-class) takes collateral damage.
- The government kills off all oppressed people.
  The non-oppressed people lives in their bubble happily ever after.
- The government slowly releases control while trying to save face.

Xi Jinping cannot release control in 2018, because if he releases control, his opponents will pounce on him, reveal all his crimes, and tarnish his name.
Xi Jinping wants to die in good standing, with good reputation; he wants to be remembered as a good person.

I hope that the next bloodshed gives the Chinese people enough reason to limit government power.

You can live a good comfortable life in China as long as you blind yourself from the truth.

Stalin's inner circle was too afraid to tell him the truth.

Stalin's inner circle told him what he wanted to hear.

After Stalin died, there was a great purge.

You know your country is led by an authoritarian if:
- You can't say the truth there.
- There is someone whom people are too afraid to disagree with, even politely.

We must respect the truth.
The truth doesn't care about us.
People who ignore the truth do so at their own peril.
Ignoring the truth means ignoring some danger;
such ignorance reduces the chance of survival.

**** Why is there no advanced Islamic country?

TLDR: I don't have an answer.

What is an Islamic country?

We can classify countries into four categories:
- non-Islamic non-advanced country (exists)
- Islamic non-advanced country (exists)
- non-Islamic advanced country (exists)
- Islamic advanced country (doesn't exist)

There are Islamic scholars.
Iran has nuclear power plants.
Such plants require advanced technical ability.

The problem is:
If there are enough religious extremists in a country,
then the whole country goes down.
The smart people die or move out, leaving only stupid people behind.
Stupid people beget more stupid people, deteriorating the country even faster.
People segregate themselves.

Forced democratization of a developing country only creates corrupt government.
For a government to be beneficial, the governed people must think critically.
The people of a developing country does not think critically.

Example of a developing country corrupted by forced democratization: Indonesia (and pretty much all developing countries).

Islam was created about 600 years after Christianity.
Does that mean Saudi Arabia in 2600 will be as advanced as the US in 2000?
Does that mean Saudi Arabia is 600 years behind the US?

Anyone who criticizes Islam risks death.
But one who rejects criticism is condemned to eternal backwardness.
If you are backward, you reject criticism.
If you reject criticism, you stay backward.
It's a vicious circle.
The only way out is waiting for backward people to die and be replaced with their children, hopefully more open-minded and capable of critical thinking and introspection.
But the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
The situation is extremely bleak.
We have billions of such people.

How the Internet went wrong in 15 steps
http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/04/an-apology-for-the-internet-from-the-people-who-built-it.html
- "Step 1: Start With Hippie Good Intentions"
- "Step 4: [...] we paid a high price for keeping [the Internet] free"
  - "To avoid charging for the internet — while becoming fabulously rich at the same time — Silicon Valley turned to digital advertising."
  - Click maximization breeds sensationalism and extremism: /anything goes/, for a click.
    - Growth at all costs.
      Growth for the sake of growth.
      Idolization of growth.
      Growth is overrated.
      Growth isn't always desirable.
  - Tristan Harris: "We cannot afford the advertising business model. The price of free is actually too high.
    It is literally destroying our society, because it incentivizes automated systems that have these inherent flaws.
    Cambridge Analytica is the easiest way of explaining why that’s true.
    Because that wasn’t an abuse by a bad actor — that was the inherent platform.
    The problem with Facebook is Facebook."
- "Step 5: Everything was designed to be really, really addictive.
 The social-media giants became 'attention merchants', bent on hooking users no matter the consequences.
 'Engagement' was the euphemism for the metric, but in practice it evolved into an unprecedented machine for behavior modification."
  - Guillaume Chaslot: "The way AI is designed will have a huge impact on the type of content you see.
    For instance, if the AI favors engagement, like on Facebook and YouTube, it will incentivize divisive content, because divisive content is very efficient to keep people online."
- Internet business model that is not advertising
  - "Step 12: To fix it, we’ll need a new business model. Maybe [...] like charging users for goods and services"
  - I think Facebook/Twitter/Reddit/YouTube can make country-level subscription that countries pay using taxpayer money.
- "Step 14: Maybe nothing will change."
- What people say
  - Tim Berners-Lee: "The fact that power is concentrated among so few companies has made it possible to weaponize the web at scale."
  - Tim Cook: "I don’t have a kid, but I have a nephew that I put some boundaries on. There are some things that I won’t allow; I don’t want them on a social network."

* Political economics
Political economics is economics with some political tinge.

Political ideals cannot escape economic reality.
Politicians cannot give everyone free lunch just by making it a law.

We tend to waste free things?
* Understand religions
** Religiosity causal chain
- A child has a religion because its parents teach it that religion.
  - Parents may revolt if we forbid them from teaching religion to their children.
- A person leaves religion because he disagrees with the religion or how others practice it.
- A person wants to apply religion because he sees it as an ideal.
- Can we send subliminal messages on TV to make religions look bad?
- People are more religious in bad times because religion numbs the pain somewhat. Religion is a psychological painkiller. Religion is addictive.
  - If we give them real-pain killing drugs, will they replace their addiction?
- People are religious because they are afraid to think for themselves. They are afraid of the unknown?
- People are religious because they fear becoming irreligious.
- How do we passivate religious people?

Poor people are more religious?
* Understand poverty
** Money, wealth, and poverty: traversing the causal chain from the proximate cause to the ultimate cause
These are two /different/ questions:
- Why does someone become rich or poor?
- Why is someone rich or poor?

A person becomes rich due to sustained surplus.
A person becomes poor due to sustained deficit.
A surplus enriches a person.
A deficit impoverishes a person.
If his expenses consistently exceeds his income, he will become poor.

Is his expenses too high?
Is his income too low?
*** Mutual causes, vicious circles; poverty, homelessness
TLDR:
Poverty causes homelessness.
Homelessness exacerbates poverty.

Which causes which, between poverty and homelessness?
To find out, answer both "How does a poor person become homeless?" and "How does a homeless person become poor?".

If the poor can increase his income, he will be able to buy a home.
But to increase his income, he need to have a home (a mailing address) first.
It's catch-22.

If the poor can get a home but not increase his income, he will lose the home, and he will be homeless again.

A homeless person doesn't have a mailing address.
Thus he can't create a bank account.
Thus he can't apply for a job.
Thus he has no income.
Thus he becomes poor.

A poor person has a house.
Thus he needs money to buy food.
Thus he sells his house.
Thus he becomes homeless.
Thus he ends up even poorer.

- The role of the media in politics:
    - The media should research/watch/monitor/summarize/audit the government for the public.
    - The media should therefore be owned by the public, and independent of the government. The media should not be funded with tax.
    - The media shapes the public opinion.
    - The media bridges the government and the public.
    - The public doesn't have the time to watch the government.
- The media is the public's opinion of the government.
- The media is whatever the public sees.
    - Shadow/private media: social media, websites, chat groups.
        - "Shadow" in the same sense as "shadow banking".
            - "Shadow" here means unofficial/non-traditional but effective.
        - They may contain hoaxes, fake news, disinformations, and the like.
- How do the public form opinion?

  - Mengapa partai?

    - Menyederhanakan pemilu.
    - Perkumpulan orang-orang setujuan?

  - Keburukan partai

    - Kebutuhan memenangkan suara membuat partai berpolitik praktis dan meninggalkan tujuannya?
    - [[https://tirto.id/corak-ideologi-partai-partai-di-indonesia-cJKc][Corak Ideologi Partai-Partai di Indonesia - Tirto.ID]]

      - Pertai di Indonesia hanya beda pendapat soal agama.

  - Partai berarti "bagian".

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: pasal-pasal-yang-perlu-dijelaskan
   :END:

Pasal-pasal ini bertujuan mulia, tetapi kata-katanya tidak jelas secara hukum, sehingga tidak bisa ditegakkan.

- Pasal 27 ayat 1:
  "Segala warga negara bersamaan kedudukannya di dalam hukum dan pemerintahan dan wajib menjunjung hukum dan pemerintahan itu dengan tidak ada kecualinya."

  - Pasal tersebut tidak cocok menjadi hukum.
    Ia bukan definisi ataupun aturan, melainkan harapan.
  - Tidak ada cara untuk menjalankan pasal tersebut.
  - Tidak ada hukuman yang jelas untuk pelanggarannya.
    (Aturan tanpa hukuman sama saja tidak ada.)
  - Aturan yang sulit di-enforce sama saja tidak ada.
  - Diskriminasi adalah bagian manusia dan akan ada selama manusia ada.

- Pasal 27 ayat 3:
  "Setiap warga negara berhak dan wajib ikut serta dalam upaya pembelaan negara."

  - Apa beda "berhak dan wajib" dan "wajib"?
  - Apa hukuman untuk pelanggarnya?
  - Apa arti kata "berhak"?
  - Bagaimana cara mengklaim suatu hak?

- Pasal 29 ayat 1: "Negara berdasar atas Ketuhanan Yang Maha Esa."

  - Apa arti kata "esa"?

    - Menurut [[https://kbbi.web.id/esa][KBBI daring]], kata "esa" berarti "satu".

  - Sebaiknya kita ganti pasal tersebut dengan kata-kata yang umum di abad 21.
    Aturan harusnya dibuat supaya mudah dipahami.

- Pasal 31

  - Pasal 31 ayat 2: "Setiap warga negara wajib mengikuti pendidikan dasar dan pemerintah wajib membiayainya."
  - Pasal 31 ayat 4: "Negara memprioritaskan anggaran pendidikan sekurang-kurangnya dua puluh persen dari anggaran pendapatan dan belanja negara serta dari anggaran pendapatan dan belanja daerah untuk memenuhi kebutuhan penyelenggaraan pendidikan nasional."
  - Apa itu artinya sekolah harus digratiskan?
    Seandainya APBN tidak cukup bagaimana?
  - Pasal 31 ayat 3: "Pemerintah mengusahakan dan menyelenggarakan satu sistem pendidikan nasional, yang meningkatkan keimanan dan ketakwaan serta ahlak mulia dalam rangka mencerdaskan kehidupan bangsa, yang diatur dengan undang-undang."

    - Ini mungkin harus diubah supaya mengikutkan "toleransi".

- Pasal 32 ayat 1: "Negara memajukan kebudayaan nasional Indonesia di tengah peradaban dunia dengan menjamin kebebasan masyarakat dalam memelihara dan mengembangkan nilai-nilai budayanya."

  - Apa itu nilai budaya?
    Apakah budaya yang buruk juga harus dipelihara?
    Apa itu "buruk"?
    Sistem moral mana yang harus dipakai pemerintah?

- Pasal 32 ayat 2: "Negara menghormati dan memelihara bahasa daerah sebagai kekayaan budaya nasional."

  - Bagaimana caranya?

- Pasal 28H ayat 4: "Setiap orang berhak mempunyai hak milik pribadi dan hak milik tersebut tidak boleh diambil alih secara sewenang-wenang oleh siapapun."

  - Pasal ini sangat tidak jelas.
  - Pajak adalah pengambilan sebagian hak milik pribadi secara paksa oleh pemerintah.
    Bagaimana hubungan pajak dan ayat ini?

    - Apa yang dimaksud "hak milik"?
      Private property?
    - Hak milik untuk apa saja?
      Semua benda?
    - Tapi kepemilikan bisa dicabut?
      Apa beda kepemilikan dan hak milik?

  - Bertentangan dengan pasal 33 ayat 3?

    - Sepertinya tidak.
      Ayat ini tidak melarang /pembatasan/ jenis benda yang bisa dimiliki pribadi.

Mungkin beberapa tambahan ini dibuat karena penculikan, penghilangan, dan penembakan misterius pada zaman Pak Harto.

- Pasal 28A: "Setiap orang berhak untuk hidup serta berhak mempertahankan hidup dan kehidupannya."
- Pasal 28B ayat 1: "Setiap orang berhak membentuk keluarga dan melanjutkan keturunan melalui perkawinan yang sah."

  - Tanpa dibolehkan pun orang akan kawin.
    Sebelum ada UUD 1945 pun orang sudah kawin.
    Mengapa bisa ada ayat ini di UUD?
    Apa latar belakangnya?
  - Setiap orang?
    Apakah semua orang boleh melanjutkan keturunan?
    Apakah orang yang tidak bisa mengurus anak sebaiknya melanjutkan keturunan?
    Apakah ekstremis sebaiknya melanjutkan keturunan?

- Pasal 28B ayat 2: "Setiap anak berhak atas kelangsungan hidup, tumbuh, dan berkembang serta berhak atas perlindungan dari kekerasan dan diskriminasi."
- Pasal 28C, 28D, 28E, 28F, 28G, 28H, 28I: you don't say. Bagaimana cara menegakannya?

- Tapi Presiden bisa memerintahkan militer untuk menyerang DPR?

  - Pasal 10: "Presiden memegang kekuasaan yang tertinggi atas Angkatan Darat, Angkatan Laut dan Angkatan Udara."

Pasal 28H ayat 2: "Setiap orang berhak mendapat kemudahan dan perlakuan khusus untuk memperoleh kesempatan dan manfaat yang sama guna mencapai persamaan dan keadilan."

Pasal 33 ayat 1: "Perekonomian disusun sebagai usaha bersama berdasar atas asas kekeluargaan."

- Apa artinya?

Pasal 33 ayat 2: "Cabang-cabang produksi yang penting bagi negara dan yang menguasai hajat hidup orang banyak dikuasai oleh negara."

Apa arti "hajat hidup orang banyak" dan "dikuasai"?
Dikuasai tidak berarti dimiliki?

Apakah Gojek hajat hidup orang banyak?
Apakah transportasi umum (Kopaja, Metromini, Mikrolet, dll.) hajat hidup orang banyak?

Pasal 33 ayat 3: "Bumi dan air dan kekayaan alam yang terkandung di dalamnya dikuasai oleh negara dan dipergunakan untuk sebesar-besar kemakmuran rakyat."

- Apa itu berarti tanah harus dikuasai negara?
  Orang tidak boleh punya tanah?
  Perusahaan air seperti Aqua, Oasis, Cleo, PAM, PDAM, dll. harus dikuasai negara?

Saya lebih suka orang tidak boleh memiliki tanah (hanya boleh menyewa tanah dari pemerintah).
Tapi bagaimana dengan bangunan di atasnya?

Pasal 33 ayat 4: "Perekonomian nasional diselenggarakan berdasar atas demokrasi ekonomi dengan prinsip kebersamaan, efisiensi berkeadilan, berkelanjutan, berwawasan lingkungan, kemandirian, serta dengan menjaga keseimbangan kemajuan dan kesatuan ekonomi nasional."

Apa arti "demokrasi ekonomi"?
Apa arti "efisiensi berkeadilan"?

"Kemandirian" berarti harus mengurangi impor, lalu memproduksi sebanyak mungkin macam barang dalam negeri?

Pasal 34 ayat 2: "Negara mengembangkan sistem jaminan sosial bagi seluruh rakyat dan memberdayakan masyarakat yang lemah dan tidak mampu sesuai dengan martabat kemanusiaan."

Mendasari BPJS, Jamsostek, dll..
Tinggal eksekusi yang baik.

Pasal 34 ayat 3: "Negara bertanggung jawab atas penyediaan fasilitas pelayanan kesehatan dan fasilitas pelayanan umum yang layak."

Mendasari RSUP, RSUD, dll.


**** <2018-09-19> Cabut aturan yang melarang hal-hal yang tidak membahayakan orang banyak.

Cabut aturan yang mengatur urusan pribadi.

**** <2018-09-19> Generalize aturan: Kriminalkan semua orang yang mengganggu ketertiban umum?

Problem: Ini bisa jadi pasal karet.

Tidak perlu ada aturan spesifik.
Aturan tentang ketertiban umum mencakup semua hal berikut:
- Membuat video porno tidak kriminal; menyebarkannya yang kriminal.
- Hubungan intim tidak kriminal; yang kriminal adalah membuat masyarakat resah.
- Menghujat tidak kriminal; yang kriminal adalah membuat masyarakat ribut.

**** <2018-09-19> Buat aturan contempt of court? Sebaiknya benahi hakim dan pengadilan dulu?

Ide Hotman Paris?

Tapi bagaimana kalau ada miscarriage of justice?
Aturan contempt of court akan memperparah miscarriage of justice.


**** Should we repeal blasphemy laws and obscenity laws?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: should-we-repeal-blasphemy-laws-and-obscenity-laws

We already have laws for people causing public disorder.

- If a person commits blasphemy and causes public disorder,
  then that perpetrator should be arrested for causing public disorder,
  not for blasphemy.
- If a person distributes obscene materials and causes public disorder,
  then that perpetrator should be arrested for causing public disorder,
  not for distributing obscene materials.
- If a person causes public disorder to overthrow a corrupt government,
  then the government will try to vanquish the rebellion,
  but the people shall prevail?
- Blasphemy laws allow angry people to fight in the courtroom.
  Without blasphemy laws, angry people would fight on the road,
  where there are no rules, taking matter into their own hands.

  - However, blasphemy laws also allow religion
    to subvert the justice system.

*** Buat profesi petani jadi menarik secara ekonomi.
*** <2018-09-19> Net neutrality, un-ban websites, Reddit, Vimeo, dll.

Tapi, apakah website ekstremis juga mau di-unblock?

**** Why is Reddit blocked in Indonesia?

- The official reason
  - Something like "Reddit is a porn site.".
  - http://www.mesinwaktu.id/2017/11/alasan-kenapa-reddit-diblokir.html
  - https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Reddit-blocked-by-the-Indonesian-government
  - Doesn't make sense.
    - There is porn on Reddit, but Reddit is not a porn site.
      There are also porn on Google, Bing, YouTube, Blogspot, but they aren't porn sites.
      Why block only Reddit?
      If you're following the law to the letter,
      why not block all of Internet?
- What I think the reason is
  - Someone in the government might need to be seen working.
    Sepertinya blokir website termasuk tugas kemkominfo dalam undang-undang.

*** Close international tax evasion loopholes

Make it impossible to hide money trail.
Require electronic cash with traceability/accounting/history.
Eliminate hard cash.

**** Rally all countries against the money-laundering countries

Tax havens are money launderers.

** Prinsip
*** My basic assumptions for legislating
- Humans are generally moral and peaceful, if their basic needs are met.
- Some humans are immoral or evil.
**** Hobbes vs Locke?
*** Start from the objective reality.
- Contoh:
  - Objektif: "Beberapa orang Indonesia tidak bisa membaca."
    Ada tes yang jelas untuk mengukur kemampuan membaca.
  - Tidak objektif: "Orang Indonesia malas."
    Apa definisi "malas"?

Bagaimana kita menjamin partai baru tidak terjerembab ke lubang korupsi?

Ada siklus:

- Partai baru didirikan karena ketidakpuasan terhadap partai lama.
- Setelah lama, partai baru jadi partai lama, dan terlibat masalah.
- Ulangi.

Kalau semua partai terlibat masalah,
sistem pemerintahan perlu diperbaiki?
Pemisahan perlu diperbaiki?
Insentif perlu dirancang lebih baik?

Forcing someone to live the life he does not want is more immoral than killing him.
This also implies:

- We should let people kill themselves if they have thought about it well, as long as they are done privately.
  - But https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2013/05/19/why-stop-someone-from-suicide/ dissents:
    - "The most important reason to prevent suicide is that suicidal crises, though formidable and painful, almost always are temporary.
      Even if the person continues thinking about suicide, the intense suicidal intent usually subsides.
      Consider that 90% of people who survive a suicide attempt do not go on to die by suicide.
      That number is very revealing.
      Even among people who wanted to die so strongly that they tried to end their life, most ultimately chose to live."
      - People don't know what they want.
        We don't know what we want.

They have trust issues with authorities.
I am also looking for friends who share my beliefs, and I also have trust issues with authorities,
but the difference between a Flat-Earther and me is that
I have trust issues with political authorities,
whereas a Flat-Earther has a trust issue with scientific authorities.
Thus, although I do not believe in Flat Earth,
a Flat-Earther and I have more commonalities than differences.
The same is true with Holocaust deniers and climate change deniers:
it is a trust issue with some authorities.

How did such trust issues arise?
Our parents, for good reason, taught us not to trust strangers.
Thus it is a logical consequence that we don't trust authorities: they are strangers!
We don't know who they are, and yet they suddenly come down telling us what is right and what is wrong.

How can two strangers be friends?
By physical closeness (being at nearby location and time) and by mental closeness (having similar ideas and beliefs).
How do we make sure that the people in power are not strangers?
It is not feasible for one person to meet millions of people.
Thus I have this corollary: /having power over more people always begets more trust issues/, simply because it is harder for the authority to not be strangers with its subjects.
Perhaps it's just that power today is too centralized.
But mass media enables centralization of power;
the authority uses mass media to make its subjects feel that the authority is familiar.
But mass communication is one-way communication.
How does one-way communication build trust?
In the same way an actor builds his fanbase of fans who trust him.
First, the would-be fans have to fall in love with him from afar, be it due to his handsomeness, his charisma, or any aspect of him that resonates with them.
But then this fanbase has to be maintained, and it is physically impossible for an actor with a million fans to be close to all of them.
Therefore what is required to maintain the fanbase is a /mass illusion/ of closeness:
the actor has to behave in such a way that makes his fans /perceive/ that he cares about /all/ of them,
whereas he can only /actually/ care about /few/ of them.
The mass media only has to show the actor's interacting with /a few/ of his fans, in order to make /all/ of his fans feel that they have been interacted with.
This is not because he is evil; he is just constrained by the laws of physics.
This technique is a double-edged sword:
it can be used to maintain political stability,
but it can also be used to lie to millions of people.
We need to teach people epistemology so that they can tell apart what they know and what they think they know.
Mass media does not give any knowledge; it only gives an illusion of knowledge.
Reading the news does not make us know anything; it only makes us think that we know.
How do I know there is a disaster somewhere?
I do not, because I can only know things near me, and it is not feasible for me to verify every claim in the news; I am merely assuming that the news is honest.
Epistemology is more important than ever in this age of falsehood.

There are some simple experiments that we can carry out to determine the curvature of the Earth.
Reality itself has told us through those experiments that the Earth is not flat; it is up to us to listen to reality or ignore it at our own peril.
We will make costly mistakes if we make antennas and satellites with Flat Earth theory.

The theory makes sense and is a fine scientific theory: it is falsifiable.
What does not make sense to me is the refusal to change one's beliefs despite being otherwise told by reality.

My thought is exactly that of George Box and of Isaac Asimov.

George Box: "All models are wrong but some are useful."[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong]

Isaac Asimov: "When people thought the Earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the Earth was spherical, they were wrong.
But if you think that thinking the Earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the Earth is flat,
then your view is wronger than both of them put together."[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wronger_than_wrong]

Thus, both the Flat Earth theory and the Spherical Earth theory are "wrong", because they are only our descriptions of reality, and not reality itself.
It's just that the Spherical Earth theory is useful in more cases, and Spherical Earth theory is useful in fewer cases.
In software terms, we can think of Flat Earth theory as an "alpha" version of Spherical Earth theory, where the "bugs" are the mismatches with reality.
Updating the "software" fixes some "bugs", but the "software" becomes more complex.

The Flat Earth theory does make testable predictions.

** Who is OYO CTO?
From a 2016 article[fn::https://www.livemint.com/Companies/GfBdOyw5rNidPCkmwc2KSJ/OYO-Rooms-appoints-Anil-Goel-as-chief-technology-officer.html]:
- In 2016, OYO gets new CTO: Anil Goel[fn::https://in.linkedin.com/in/anilgoel1]
- 20 years of experience in technology infrastructure
- past head of technology for customer returns and reverse logistics at Amazon India in Hyderabad for three years
- past chief technology officer of Hike Messenger

Is he more of the practical-type than the researcher-type?
Is he more about business than about research?
One interview question is "What is considered as a good business plan?"
 [fn::https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/oyo-rooms-interview-experience-for-software-engineer/]

"[...] he went to BITS Pilani in 1991"[fn::https://yourstory.com/2018/02/techie-tuesdays-anil-goel].
Thus he was probably 18 years old in 1991, and 46 years old in 2019.

A damning review from "Join OYO only if you are desperate. Honest 2018 review with no bias."
Current Employee - Software Engineer in Gurgaon, Haryana[fn::https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-OYO-RVW22416076.htm]:
- Politics , politics everywhere.
- Large salary disparity.
  You'll join only to know there are ppl in your team getting much higher than you get and than they deserve.
  CTO has a fetish for hiring people from Hike and Amazon.
He has worked at both places earlier.
So he's pretty much bringing in everyone he knows from these places (I am not saying they are not good), but they will be given important roles than you, without question.
- Almost all old employees have left/asked to leave Here's a red flag.
  The employees who joined during the time of old VP Ajay were now being called non-smart hires.
  The CTO has replaced EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM.
  They were the people who gave their blood and sweat to build OYO as it is today.
  OYO has a technique to make you leave the company now.
  They'll hire someone totally new and make them sit over you on higher position, to take away you responsibilities.
  Or they'll just give you no hike.
  So you'll and leave.
  I was hired after the new CTO came but the older guys were so awesome.
  Now there are hardly 5 older guys left.
  Whole tech team replaced.
- There's a flood of freshers.
  They hired more than 200 freshers in one batch from IITs(any branch)/good colleges against 70 devs who were left at one time.
  No one has any idea of the legacy system.
  There's total chaos.
  Much time goes in doing their ramp up if you're an old employee.
  So by the evening you'll feel to do the work yourself instead of teaching them everything.
- In the last 6 months, they made jokingly new teams,to accommodate the new hires, and hired managers from outside for almost all of them.
  most of them total jerks.
- 90% people leave within 1 year of joining.
  So my advice: If you're a fresher or don't have any opportunity from anywhere else.
  OYO will be a good place as you can learn.
  But then again come with no expectations of respect or growth, as you'll watch it getting shattered within 6 months.
  My papers on their way.

But there are other good reviews too.

*** September 2018 sexual harassment
In September 2018, a female guest Jordan Taylor reported sexual harassment by some staffs in an OYO-branded property.
- https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/stalked-trapped-hotel-us-travel-blogger-recounts-sexual-harassment-india-88186

I think this is a culture clash.

From the point of view of the perpetrators, they were teasing the girl.
I don't think those Indian guys really dared to rape her,
because they would surely go to jail if they did.

However, from the point of the Western girl (and also Western people in general),
that interaction is really creepy, abnormal, and outside the bounds of civility.

Nonetheless, it is improper and totally unacceptable for workers in the hospitality industry to behave like that,
because they are in the hospitality industry, and they are expected to be hospitable.

"However OYO maintains that few incidents are insignificant compared to millions of check-ins happening everyday and the company tries to remedy any problem."

It was also reported that OYO was not following its own agreements and have threatened the hotels to

"It was reported by Business Standard in 2017 that OYO rooms were making massive losses without showing any significant revenues."
