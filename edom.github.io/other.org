* The purposes of this page
- This page is a holding area for my capture-refile workflow.
- This page is for recycling old content.
* Things that I perhaps should do
** TODO <2018-09-15> Fix possible programming error in ~/work/web in Iterables.filter
** TODO <2018-09-15> Modernize operating system
Back up data.
Should not take more than a day.
*** TODO <2018-09-15> Install +Ubuntu 18.04 after its point release+ Debian
Ubuntu 14.04 EOL is April 2019.

<2018-10-26> I'm using Ubuntu 14.04.

When Ubuntu 14.04 reaches its end of life, I'll move to Debian.
I won't upgrade to Ubuntu 18.04.

** TODO Ask others
*** Who should we ask?
- Haskell Cafe mailing list
- #haskell on freenode IRC
- Haskell reddit
- Abdullah
*** TODO <2018-09-17> Is there anything like Pandoc but for programming languages instead of markup languages?
Does anyone know of anything like Pandoc but for programming languages?

For example, it would translate Haskell to Java by translating Haskell into an internal representation and then translating that internal representation to Java.

Possible related things:
- LLVM IR
- GHC Core
* Pragmatic ontology: how pragmatism can help us answer what something is
(Is this really what others mean by "pragmatic ontology"?)

To the pragmatic ontologist, "exist" means "practically exist".

Someone who subscribes to egocentric pragmatic ontology would take the question "What is X?" to mean "What can I use X for? / How can I use X?"

- I can use it, therefore it exists. (Compare: Descartes's "I think, therefore I exist.")
- It affects me, therefore it exists.
* Getting rich
** What?
- Which is more fundamental, economics or finance?
  Which is built on which?

- Why get rich?

  - Get more power.
  - Change the world.
    Bend the world to your will.
    Impose your ideals onto the world.
  - Actualize your dreams.

- The problem with opening a business is too many choices.

  - Almost all businesses make money.
  - Every obvious business idea is already taken.

  - Use credit card, not debit card.

    - Use credit card, but don't fall into debt.
      Treat credit card as means of payment, not loan.
    - Never use debit card outside trusted ATMs.
    - But what about cash withdrawals from ATMs?
      Credit cards have higher fees.

  - Passwordless authentication

    - Authentication with a phone, without username, without password: [[https://www.trusona.com/][Trusona]], from the Frank Abagnale 2017 Google talk above.

- What is money?

  - Money is a way for people to decide what is important (vote for what is important).

    - People vote with their money.

- The job of a company (a company director?) is to find what to do and find who should do it.

  - Everyone has different tendencies, strengths, weaknesses, desires, preferences, habits, upbringings, backgrounds.
  - Some people are more suited for some jobs.

    - Some jobs require high IQ; otherwise the employee will take too long to learn.
    - Some jobs require low IQ; otherwise the employee will get bored too soon.

      - Yes, low IQ can be a strength.

  - The company has goals.
  - The director breaks down the goals into jobs.
  - The director matches employees and jobs.
  - Which comes first: the job or the employee?

    - Do you formulate a job description first, and then find people to do that?
    - Do you hire people first, and then formulate jobs suitable for them?

  - A good company accomplishes more than each employee can accomplish individually.

    - Difference between post-Westphalian worldview and Millenial worldview.

      - The 21st century way of living is radically different.
        Different ideas of freedom.

        - In the post-Westphalian worldview, freedom means sovereignty, being autonomous, being an island.

    - Second Industrial Revolution teaches kids to be factory workers. Obedient. Unquestioning. Hardworking.

  - Corporates were invented by aristocrats to make sure peasants stay peasants?
  - [[https://bigthink.com/videos/douglas-rushkoff-on-the-internet-and-the-future-of-business][transcript]]

    - We should verify and distill these texts.
      These are some bold claims.

      - "As the peasants became wealthy the aristocracy got scared, who are these people?
        They're not going to be dependent on us any more.
        So they came up with two main financial innovations to prevent the rise of this peer to peer economy.
        The first one was the chartered monopoly, really the parent to the modern corporation.
        All the chartered monopoly was was a way to say all of you small businesses are now illegal.
        If you want to be in the shoe business you have to work for his majesty's royal shoe company.
        You want to be in the grain business you have to work for his majesty's royal grain company.
        So people who were small business people now became employees.
        Instead of selling the value they created, now they sold their time as servants, as wage laborers."
      - "The second invention they came up with was central currency.
        Not such a terrible thing in itself.
        It's great to have a long distance currency that lots of people can use and value, but the problem was they made all of the local currencies illegal.
        So the only way people could trade with each other, the candlestick maker could trade with the chicken farmer was by borrowing central currency from the treasury.
        So now you had to borrow money at interest just in order to transact.
        And that set in motion really a growth cascade.
        If you have a currency that has to be paid back with interest, in order to just make end meet you need an economy that's growing.
        You need more money next year than there was this year."
      - "So that worked well for colonial powers, as long as we could extend into Africa and South America and North America, find slaves, find new resources, we could grow.
        But what happens when you reach the end of the planet's growth as we did really at the end of World War II?"

- Work-life balance?

  - Life /is/ work.
  - Your work defines you.
    You are only as good as your contribution to the world.
    Your work defines the meaning of your life.
  - Don't confuse working with employment.

    - Work is everything that creates value.
    - Employment is just a kind of work.

  - Don't confuse being busy and working.

    - Work should create value.
    - You can feel busy while not producing anything.
    - Work has goals. Being busy doesn't have goals.

  - People don't care about processes.
    They only care about results.
  - If you are not working in all your waking hours, then it's not the work you want.
  - If I could work in my sleep, I would!

- Transport is waste.
  Hence travel is waste.
- Why can't people stay at home on holidays?

  - If you don't like staying at home on holidays, that means something is wrong with your home.
    Fix it.
    Make it the best place on Earth.
    Face reality.
    Don't escape.

- Communism

  - The USSR was beyond communism; it was Stalinism.
  - Stalinism failed because it overcentralizes power.

    - Power corrupts.
    - Oppression isn't a good long-term strategy.
    - People are like gas.

      - Increasing pressure (oppression, stress, overcrowding) increases temperature (collisions, friction, conflicts, clashes).

  - People would still work even if they couldn't get rich.

    - People work to give their life meaning, not to get rich.

      - Getting rich is a side-effect.

    - Would they work better if they could get rich?

- If you buy land and let it idle, only to sell it higher in the future, then you're /seeking rent/.

  - You are not creating any value.
    You burden society.
    You get rich by burdening others, making them poorer.
    The world is better without you.
    You contribute to city sprawl, which causes winding roads, more fuel consumption, more traffic, more pollution, and more heat.
    You should be heavily taxed for the huge negative externality you cause.

- Is all speculation rent-seeking?
** Capitalism
- What is capitalism?

  - Capitalism is:

    1. the /private ownership/ of means of production,
    2. the operation of such means /for profit/.

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism][WP: Capitalism]].

- How is it good?

  - Capitalism enables selfish people to better everyone else.
  - Voluntary exchange betters everyone.

    - People don't agree to a deal they think bad for them.

- How is it bad?

  - Wealth gap? Social gap?
  - Capitalism places capital above labor?
  - Short-term profit-seeking and rent-seeking destroys environment and humanity?

- How can it be improved?

  - Regulation

    - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOaJe68C-bU][How to Improve Capitalism]]

  - Capitalism can be environmentally friendly if the polluters pay the environmental costs.

    - 2018: other people are still paying the cost. (Negative externality)

      - Can sustainability be made profitable?

        - Pessimistic sources

- How does employment and slavery compare?

  - Slavery is the ownership of humans.
  - Employment is the rental of humans.
  - How has slavery changed?

    - Humans used to buy humans. Now humans rent other humans.

      - 2018: we can even rent a friend.

    - "Hiring" /is/ "renting".

      - You rent a car. The contract includes an insurance. You use the car for anything; just don't break it.
      - You hire an employee. The contract includes an insurance. You use the employee for anything; just don't break it.

    - [[http://www.differencebetween.net/business/difference-between-labor-and-human-capital/][differencebetween.net: labor and human capital]]

- Ramble

  - Companies must extract value to survive.

    - A profitable company must extract more value
      from its employees than it pays its employees.

      - People create value. People in a company create value. Human labor creates value.
        Companies aren't human. Companies can't work. It's the employees who work.
      - But if the employees weren't in the company, they might create less value.
        The company might be a place where the employees can create more value for society.

- http://www.visualcapitalist.com/
- Capital is everything that is not labor?
- Capitalism is capital above labor? Communism is labor above capital?
- Example of low-capital high-labor:

  - small and medium enterprises (SMEs)

    - food stalls
    - home bakeries
    - art freelancing

  - research in pure mathematics

- Everyday there are stocks that rise by 20% and there are stocks that fall by 20%.

  - If we can predict which will rise, we can get rich quickly.

    - Because less people sell.

  - How do we persuade/encourage people to buy a stock?
    How do you market a stock?

    - This is gray area.
      Is it even legal?

  - How do we prevent sellers from selling?

- Hypothesis: Some companies' financial statements predict economic/financial crises.

  - How are economic crises even possible if there is enough money for everybody?

    - Uneven distribution of money?
    - Hypothesis: The solution to an economic crisis is a forced redistribution of money, an economic reboot/restart, however unpleasant.

      - In an economic crisis, tax the wealthy and pay the poor.
      - I think that is an optimal solution (if not the only solution), but that is politically incorrect, so we'll never see that.

    - If ignored, economic crisis will escalate to sociopolitical crisis.

- Banks lend money with interest.
  Thus, paying back the loans reduce circulating money.

- ontology

  - wealth

    - /Wealth/ is the sum of satisfied wants.

  - price, pay, ownership, exchange, transaction

    - To /own/ something is to have exclusive access to that thing.
    - /Exchange/ and /transaction/ are synonyms.
    - An /exchange/ is an agreement

      - between two parties A and B where

        - A gives X to B,
        - B gives Y to A.

    - If X is money and Y is not money, then:

      - X is the price.

        - /Price/ is the amount agreed for exchange.
        - /Price/ is something sacrificed to get something else.

      - A is the buyer.
      - B is the seller.
      - The buyer /pays/ the price to the seller.

  - negotiation, price-taker, price-maker

    - Negotiating parties often have asymmetrical bargaining power.
    - The price-taker is the weaker one.
    - The price-maker is the stronger one.

  - money and currency

    - Money has /currency/ and /amount/ (/magnitude/).
    - Money can be /exchanged/ with many other things.

  - debt, interest, and price

    - The price of debt is the /interest/
      (the amount of money that will be exchanged for obtaining the loan now).

      - An X market is a market where X is traded.

        - A money market is a market where money is traded.

          - How do you buy money with money?

- Assumptions

  - Every human:

    - Has wants.
    - Has priorities? Utility function?

      - Non-constructive? It exists, but we don't know what it is?

    - Acts to satisfy those wants.

- Counterexamples? Where the theory breaks down?

  - Thiefs want something more than freedom?

    - But both of the stolen thing and the freedom will be taken away?

  - Smokers and junk food eaters don't want health?

    - Everybody wants health?

      - But doesn't behave consistent with wants?

        - Cognitive dissonance?

          - Want health later or health now?
          - Addiction?

            - Physical changes to the brain?

- Fundamentals of economics

  - Everybody wants something.
  - How do we satisfy more people using less resources?

- Higher-order belief

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest][WP:Keynesian beauty contest]]
  - Examples of higher-order beliefs:

    - People believe that money is valuable because they believe
      that others also believe that money is valuable.

- How do we give more than we take?

  - How do we produce more than we consume?

- Land > Labor > Capital

  - The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production][factors of production]]
    in classical economics are:

    - land (all other things that exist in nature),
    - labor (human),
    - capital (tools).

  - Land creates labor.
  - Labor creates capital.
  - If capital is destroyed, labor can rebuild it.
  - If labor is destroyed, capital cannot rebuild it.
  - Labor without capital is inefficient.
  - Capital without labor is /nothing/.
  - However, without land, nothing would exist at all.
  - Therefore, land is more important than labor, and labor is more important than capital,

    - but it seems here that capital is revered, labor is disdained, and land is forgotten.

  - Money is not capital, but it can be used to buy capital, but this quote is related:
    > When the last tree is cut, the last fish is caught, and the last river is polluted;
    > when to breathe the air is sickening, you will realize, too late,
    > that wealth is not in bank accounts and that you can't eat money.
    >

- Tax

  - Tax enables government to redistribute money (and therefore some wealth).
  - Tax enables government to discourage the consumption of certain goods.
  - Taxation is legalized robbery.

    - The government forcibly takes some of the people's money.
    - The people doesn't get to decide what the tax money is used for.

      - The government is assumed to use that money for the people's good.

  - How does one arrive at this? How does one think? What is the argument?

- If the total amount of money is constant,

  is to make someone else has less money.

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism][WP:Mercantilism]] assumes that the total wealth in the world is constant?

- Questions I haven't been able to answer

  - If everybody needs to buy food, then why aren't farmers the richest people on Earth?

    - What if the farmers don't spend?

      - Will money collect at the farmers?
      - Will they be the richest people on Earth?

- Money circulation

  - Circulating money amount should be proportional to amount of goods/services exchanged?
  - The amount of money in circulation can be reduced by tax or destruction.
  - Why do governments sell bonds?

    - To reduce the amount of money in circulation now?

      - At the cost of increasing a bigger amount of money circulating in the future?

  - Money moves faster in certain areas?
  - How does the government increases the amount of money in circulation?

    - How I think it might be done:

      - Create new money.
      - Spend that money by buying things from a few elites,

        - with the hope that the elites will quickly spend that money to the lesser elites.

          - Thus that money will circulate to more people.

            - But isn't this trickle-down economics?

    - But does it even do this? Isn't it the banks?

  - What is the effect of people's borrowing from banks?

    - Increase circulating money now (boom part of boom-bust cycle).
    - Reduce /more/ circulating money later (bust part of boom-bust cycle, when the loan is paid back with interest).

      - Principal plus interest (money retired) is greater than principal (money created),
        so the net effect of lending money now
        is a delayed reduction of a greater amount of money in circulation.

        - Where does the money to pay the interest come from?

          - If left alone, eventually the money collects at the banks?

            - But banks have expenses too.

              - Banks need to pay taxes, pay their utility bills,
                pay their staffs.

            - But shouldn't the money collect at the farmers?

  - The ideal inflation rate is zero?

** Defining investing, trading, gambling, betting, wagering, insurance
*** Defining gambling
We say that a person /gambles/ iff he bets on an outcome that he doesn't know how to control at all.

Thus, there are two necessary conditions for something to be a gamble:
- There exists a bet.
- There does not exist control.

Other definitions of gambling:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling
- US legal definition https://definitions.uslegal.com/g/gambling/
*** How do we know something is not gambling?
**** If it's possible to be skillful, then it's not gambling.
*** What
- Investing
- Trading
- Betting
- Random/uncontrollable
- Individual outcome is unpredictable

Can two unskilled people playing chess control the outcome?

Wager and bet are synonyms.

The gambler doesn't have /any/ control over the outcome of a gamble.
How do we know if someone has some control? The ability to affect outcome. By how much? By physical explanation?
Too hard to predict?

The gamblers are gambling, but the casino isn't.
The casino can control the outcome.

Although the individual outcomes are unpredictable, the trend is predictable.

Insurance is reverse gambling, which is also gambling.
It is absurd to buy something that you avoid using.

- "What makes gambling wrong but insurance right?" https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38905963
- https://seekingalpha.com/article/4080260-insurance-gambling-seriously
  - "Insurance is a very specific type of gambling."
  - "Two parties agree on the consideration (by calling that wager a premium instead),
    the type of chance (by using expectations of when the insured might die, for example),
    and a prize (by referring to the winnings as a death benefit)."

Can you insure yourself against loss at the casino?

Is professional poker gambling?
If a skilled player can consistently beat an unskilled player, than the skilled player can control the outcome, and thus the skilled player is not gambling.

If skill (improvement) is possible, then it isn't gambling.

Can you be skilled in throwing dice so that you can consistently beat unskilled people?
Slot machines?
Guessing computer-generated numbers?
What is a possible physical explanation?

How do we argue that binary option is gambling?

I saw binary options marketed with fake Facebook comments.
I know those Facebook comments are fake because all of them have perfect grammar, capitalization, and punctuation.
Real Facebook comment threads are full of shit.

** Brain study, psychedelics, and anesthetics
We still don't know how psychedelics and anesthetics work.
** Distributed systems

*** Why users don't use distributed systems

  - "Decentralized systems will continue to lose to centralized systems until there's a driver requiring decentralization to deliver a clearly superior consumer experience."
    - Users don't care.
      They want software to just work.

*** Freedom pack?

- We should make a "freedom pack": an installer of essential free/libre open-source distributed-web applications.
  The pack might contain things like yacy.net, matrix.org, riot.im.
  - Why stop there? Why not make free/libre distributed operating system with all those goodies preinstalled?

** Economics
*** Cooperatives?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: cooperatives
   :END:

What is the difference between cooperative and nonprofit?

Do cooperatives have limited liabilities like limited liability companies?

Cooperative is not a legal form?

How to measure member contribution?
This is hard, if even possible at all.
Thus it's a bad idea to distribute profit according to member contribution.
An alternative way to distribute is
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs][WP:From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]],
but it only works if there is abundance.

*** Should we assume scarcity or abundance?

- Which assumption is better?
  - Assumption of scarcity: Human always wants more than what exists. There is never enough resources for everybody.
  - Assumption of abundance: There is a point where humans are satisfied. There are enough resources for everybody.

I think the assumption of abundance is saner.
But unfortunately it seems to lead to communism.

*** Converting between goods and services
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: converting-between-goods-and-services
   :END:

SaaS converts goods (software) into services.
If you have goods, and you want to make it a service, then you host a software that controls access to that goods.

Robot converts services into goods.
If you have a service, and you want to make it a goods, then you make a robot that does that service.

*** The law of demand and supply only happens with order-book-like markets?

*** <2018-09-11> Microeconomics
An economy consists of actors.

- No economic actor has complete view of the economy.
  Every actor can only see his suppliers and consumers.
- Every actor responds only to what immediately affects it: its direct suppliers and consumers.
- Actors need time to respond to change in demand/supply.
- Some actors maintain buffers/inventories.
- Some actors get involved in futures.

Hypotheses:

- Shocks ripple through actors.
- Demand collapse may waste inventory.

Statistics can give us an accurate picture of the economy.
Random sampling of actors.
** OS magics

** Living in the 21th century? Rejecting reality?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rejecting-reality
   :END:

In year 1000 AD who would have thought that 1000 years later we would have AI deepfakes,
human sex change (sex reassignment surgery, hormone therapy),
and what else reality-bending technologies we have.

In 2018 those technologies aren't perfect.
We can see deepfake artifacts.
We can tell apart transsexuals from their hips.
Maybe in the future those technologies will be perfected.
Maybe in the future people can be whoever they want to be.
"You are who you want to be" is getting more literal.

When that time comes, we will have more respect for philosophers.
If everything is easy to fake, then what is real, and how do we know it's real?
If everything is easy to fake, then what can be taken as proof in court?
What really exists?
If a man can easily become a woman, and a woman can easily become a man, then what does it mean to be a man/woman?
Do ID cards still make sense if you are immortal and you change your identity every 6 months?
Technology will force us to deal with ontology and epistemology.

Reality discontents humans.
We work hard to deceive our senses so that we can escape reality.
We try to make imagination real, and make reality irrelevant.
The Matrix is getting real.

*** Data, customers, and reality

  - Higher IQ means faster learning, and that's all.
  - To each according to their ability.

*** We should use machine learning to hire?
*** Hiring standards, what to test in work sample tests
**** IOT engineer
Must master some of hardware, software, and business.

- Software
  - C++ smart pointers
- Hardware
  - soldering skills
  - basic understanding of electric circuits
  - designing and making PCBs, including local knowledge of where to buy components and services

What the employer may expect the employee to do:

- design and make systems (hardware and software) with constrained production cost and field operation
- maintain existing programs written in C++/Java (or whatever the employer uses), including documenting software
- travel to maintain remote hardware
*** What is the best predictor?
According to [[http://blog.eskill.com/best-worst-predictors/][eskill.com]]:
- past behavior
- conscientiousness (what is this? how do we test this?)
- cognitive ability

Interviews must be structured.
Unstructured interviews waste time.

[[https://resources.workable.com/blog/conduct-structured-interview][How to conduct a structured interview | Workable]]

We can test skill.

How do we test behavior?

Questions are unreliable.
Actions are reliable.

Where is the research paper?

How does Google hire?

What is the best predictor of on-the-job performance?
How do we interview to best predict on-the-job/post-interview performance?
- the reputation of recent employers (2 years?), and how long the employee worked at those employers
- past experience
- work sample test
- education/university
- IQ
- github
- tricky questions
- school grades
- what else?

Is there evidence-based hiring like evidence-based medicine?

Can we use machine learning to hire people?
[[https://www.criteriacorp.com/resources/whitepaper_tests_versus_humans.php][Can Pre-Employment Tests Predict Employee Success Better than a Human?]]
*** Uncertainty in hiring
In hiring, if a candidate leaves good impressions (not exceptional, but decent nonetheless), but you aren't sure about him, should you just reject him?
Does "maybe" mean "no"?
*** To avoid wasting time, begin with the most selective test.
Begin with the test with the highest failure ratio.
End the interview as soon as the candidates fail the test.
Respect their time and your time.
Don't force them to do what they can't do well.
Don't set them up to fail.
If you aren't going to hire them, don't waste their time.
*** Recruitment pipeline
- Review the resume / curriculum vitae.
*** You know your job ad is wrong when...
You know your job ad is wrong when you have to obviously reject a lot of candidates without thinking.

People don't read the job description.
People only read the job title.

To make sure that people read the job description, you can require that the applicant include a secret word that can only be found in the job ad.
Auto-reject people who don't read the job description.

**** How does swapping the subject and the predicate changes the meaning of a copular sentence (a sentence whose verb is the copula)? Subject-predicate asymmetry?
We consider sentences of these forms: "X is Y" and "Y is X", where each of X and Y is a noun phrase.

We are interested in how swapping X and Y changes the meaning of the sentence.

  :END:

The variant discussed here is classic Chinese mahjong.

*** Basic facts
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: basic-facts
   :END:

There are 136 mahjong tiles,
of which 52 are dealed to the players.
The remaining 84 forms the wall.
Thus, in a play, you only get at most 21 chances to change your hand,
that is 84 divided by 4 (the number of players).

If each player takes 15 seconds, then a hand
will take at most 4 x 15 x 21 = 1,260 seconds (21 minutes).

There are 136 tiles (not including 4 flower tiles and 4 season tiles):

There are 3 suits (bams, dots, and chars). Each suit has 9 classes. Each number has 4 instances. Thus each suit has 36 tiles. Thus there are 108 suit tiles.

There are 7 honors (4 winds and 3 dragons). Each honor has 4 instances. Thus there are 28 honor tiles.

There are 27 suit classes and 7 honor classes, giving a total of 34 classes.

Each tile class has 4 instances.

Each tile is equally probable to be drawn.

The probability of picking a tile class is 4/136. The odds of picking a tile class is 4:132.

*** Number of chows, pungs, and kongs
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: number-of-chows-pungs-and-kongs
   :END:

The probability of drawing a pung:
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 * 2/134 = 1/3,015 (odd of 1 : 3,014, approx 1 : 3,000)

Each suit has 7 unique chows: 123, 234, 345, 456, 567, 678, 789.
There are 3 suits, so there are 21 unique chows.
Each tile has 4 instances.
Each chow has 4^3 instances.
The probability of drawing a chow: 21 * 4^3 / (136 * 135 * 134) = 28 / 51,255
(odd of 1 : 51,227, approx 1 : 51,000).

Pung is more likely than chow. Is this a calculation mistake?

The probability of drawing a kong (four identical tiles):
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 * 2/134 * 1/133 = 1/400,995 (odd of 1 : 400,994, approx 1 : 401,000)

The probability of drawing a pair:
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 = 1/45 (odd of 1 : 44)

The probability of drawing two tiles having the same class:
4/136 * 3/135 = 1/1,530 (odd of 1 : 1,529)

The probability of drawing two tiles having the same suit (3 suits):
3 * 36/136 * 35/135 = 7/34 (odd of 7 : 27, approx 1 : 4)

The probability of drawing a chow:
The probability of drawing n, n+1, n+2 unordered of the same suit, for n in 1 to 7:

3! * 3 * 7 * 4/136 * 4/135 * 4/134 = 56/17,085 (odd of 56 : 17,029, about 1 : 304)

The probability of drawing a pair, given that one tile has been drawn by another player:

Let each player draw exactly one tile. The probability of four players drawing the same tile:
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 * 2/134 * 1/133 = the probability of drawing a kong

        - =sudo adduser $SUDO_USER yacy=, replace =$SUDO_USER= with your non-yacy user
        - =sudo chown -R yacy:yacy=

      - Build YaCy

        - =sudo -u yacy -H /bin/bash= for shell
        - In that shell:

          - =ant clean all=

      - Start YaCy

        - Still in the yacy shell:

          - =./startYACY.sh -f= to start YaCy in foreground

      - Use YaCy

        - Open [[http://localhost:8090/]]

      - Can we make it easier to setup YaCy peer network?

        - My scenario is typical:

          - I'm behind two layers of NAT: my ISP's router, and my USB-tethered Android phone.
          - Overlay network? VPN? Hosting on cloud?

      - Should we host YaCy on GCP (Google Cloud Platform)?
        It's cheap (USD 4.28 per month in us-west-1/us-central-1/us-east-1? Really? What about network data transfer costs into?).
        It might be even cheaper (GCP free tier).

- I propose this for the Israel-Palestine problem:

    - Establish a new country (say "Ispal"), merging Israel and Palestine.

  - Government

    - Everyone in the Israeli government is in the Ispalian government.
    - Everyone in the Palestinian government is in the Ispalian government.

  - Land

    - The land of Ispal is the land of Israel plus the land of Palestine.

  - Citizen

    - Every Israeli is an Ispalian.
    - Every Palestinian is an Ispalian.

  - Law

    - Every Ispalian is equal before the law.

*** violin
This is my study notes, observations, and conclusions.
This is a bit disorganized.

I play the violin without chin rest and shoulder rest.
**** The right pinky
The right pinky is for playing softly:
tilt the bow very slightly by pressing down the pinky (with the thumb as the fulcrum).
XXX: Is it by flexing the pinky or by supinating the hand?

Playing softly is harder than playing loudly.
Playing softly also uses more tension than playing loudly.
**** Squeaking
Each bow speed has a range of pressure that will make a good sound.
Less bow speed needs less pressure.
The symptom of too much pressure for a bow speed is squeaking;
increase the bow speed, or decrease the bow pressure, or both.

Decrease the bow pressure by pressing the end of the bow with the right pinky,
with the thumb as the fulcrum.
**** Playing open strings
Open strings, especially the A and E strings,
sound brighter than stopped strings,
so open strings will be perceived as louder
even though the bow speed and pressure stay the same.
In order to play scales with even dynamics,
we can avoid open strings,
or we can bow the open strings more softly
with reduced pressure and speed.

Also, we can play the D string nearer to the bridge to brighten it,
and the A string nearer to the fingerboard to darken it,
to make the change from the D to the A string smoother.
**** Idea for group practice
Learning Kreutzer etudes together?
**** Bouncing bows
The hairs act as a spring.

Vertical component of stick-slip.

Act as torque with the right thumb as the fulcrum.
*** wikia

*** Self-care, grooming, health, fitness
**** crisis
***** Disclaimer
This is my opinion.
***** Are you really having a crisis?
****** Make sure you're well-nourished.
Malnutrition can worsen mood.

Eat fruit, vegetable, and meat, if they don't make you sick.
Avoid too much processed food.
Avoid sugar.
Avoid flour.
Avoid burnt food.
Avoid sauces and condiments bought from supermarket.
Always read ingredients and nutrition facts.
If you want to snack, eat fruit, vegetable, or meat.
Eat whenever you want to eat, as long as the food is healthy.

You know you eat something with too much sugar if, an hour after eating it, your mouth tastes sour and smells bad.
That's the smell of sugar-eating bacteria party.

Appreciate hunger.
Learn to love being slightly hungry.
Eat attentively.
Taste every inch of the food.
Remember the flavor of the first bite.
Observe that the second bite tastes less.
Observe that the next bites tastes even less.
If you can't taste it, it means you have enough.

The first bite is joy.
Then it's okay.
Then it's unpleasant.
Then you'd rather eat something else.

If you want to always feel the joy of the first bite:
eat the first bite, rinse/gargle your mouth with water, rest your mouth until it tastes neutral, and then eat the next bite, and repeat.

Attentiveness can also help you quit smoking.
Smoke attentively.
Taste everything.
Taste the bitterness.
Think: do you really enjoy it?
People continue to smoke because they have learned to ignore the bad taste.
Normal people doesn't spontaneously seek to smoke because smoking tastes bad.
It's bitter.
It irritates the throat.
Why the hell would anyone like to choke and cough?
****** Exercise.
Exercise affects mood.
Exercise affects the brain.

You don't care about weight.
You want to gain muscle.
You want strength and flexibility.

Think like a kid who can't stop moving.
Simply will yourself to move.
Think that you love to move.
You can't stop moving.
You just want to move.
Squat.
****** If you're depressed, consult a health professional.
If you have depression, especially if you have depression running in your family, consult a health professional.

Matter affects mind.
Medication changes mood.
***** What is the meaning of life? Wrong question.
What do you want to do?

How do you justify your life?
How do others justify your life?
How do you justify others' lives?

Work simply means useful act.
It isn't about employment in a company.

Work justifies its author.
A deed justifies its doer.
(To justify is to give a reason for existence.)

Work-life balance is self-defeating.
Work justifies life.
Life is work.
If your work is not your life, you should find another work.
If you don't know what you want to do in your whole life, you're letting others waste your life.

After one copes with nihilism, there are only two outcomes: actualization (optimistic nihilism) or suicide (pessimistic nihilism).
***** Feeling is required.
Solving the crisis requires feeling.
Thinking without feeling worsens the crisis.

Why work?
Because not working feels weird.
Try not working for one year.
I did.
At first, it felt liberating.
After a month, it felt boring.
My mistake was that I quit my job emotionally without knowing what to do next.
The only right reason to quit your job is that you have something you absolutely surely want to accomplish in the rest of your life.
Fleeing from your boss is not an accomplishment.

- How long to lose fat?

  - Weight changes very slowly, about 0.5 kg per week, too slow for us to realize.
    Time flies by, and suddenly it's been 2 months since you begin eating junk food,
    and now your pants don't fit.
    You gain 0.5 kg per week over one year,
    but you expect to lose those 26 kg in a week,
    which is not realistic.
  - 1 gram fat is 9 kcal.
    1 kg fat is 9000 kcal.
    If daily deficit is 1000 kcal (this may be too big; it will make you feel shit),
    you need 9 days to lose 1 kg.
    Losing 10 kg of fat won't take sooner than 90 days (3 months).
  - Focus on strength and health, not weight.

    Too much potassium?
    Hyperkalemia?
  - Banana spoils more easily than potato.
  - Potato needs washing and 20 minutes of simmering.
  - Wikipedia has a
    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food#Nutritional_content][table comparing the nutritional contents of common staple foods]].
  - Bananas?
    Don't need cooking.
    Have less poisoning risk than potato;
    Have no solanine.
    More hygienic (hanging in treetops, not buried in soil).
    Have shorter shelf life than potato.
  - Per kilogram, banana is slightly more expensive than potato: $2.30 vs $2.10.
    By bananas I mean the Cavendish banana.
  - I'll just eat bananas instead of potatos for carbohydrate.
  - Banana is a fruit; potato is a tuber.
  - Pan-frying egg takes 10 minutes.
  - Can boil eggs and potatos together.
  - Carrots grow in soil.
  - Broccoli?
    Beans?
    Cauliflower?
  - Fruits are faster than fast food.
    No need to cook.
    No need to wait.
    Just peel and eat.
  - Cooking

    - Frying is faster than boiling.
      Boiling is faster than steaming.
      Therefore frying uses less gas.
    - LPG flame temperature is constant (the blue flame temperature is about 2000 K).
      Flame size affects the heat transfer rate.
      Make sure that the utensil cover the ring.
      Undersized utensils waste the flame heat.

    - Would you eat pesticides, antibiotics, or hormones?
      Which is the least dangerous?
    - Sunkist orange is hard to open.
    - Apples? Too hard on the teeth.
    - Avocados? Expensive. Take too long to ripen.

  - You can eat aloe vera?

- What is trans fat? Why is trans fat bad?

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat][WP:Trans fat]]

    - "trans-unsaturated fatty acid"

- How is trans fat generated?

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat][WP:Trans fat]]

    - "Fats contain long hydrocarbon chains, which can either be unsaturated, i.e., have double bonds, or saturated, i.e., have no double bonds. In nature, unsaturated fatty acids generally have cis as opposed to trans configurations.[5] In food production, liquid cis-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties, e.g. they melt at a desirable temperature (30--40 °C). Partial hydrogenation of the unsaturated fat converts some of the cis double bonds into trans double bonds by an isomerization reaction with the catalyst used for the hydrogenation, which yields a trans fat.[2][3]"

**** egg
***** Materials
- Eggs (chicken eggs assumed)
***** Boiling eggs
For efficiency,
you can boil eggs and potatoes together.
Put a lid on the pot.

1. Wash the eggs and potatoes.
2. Submerge them under the water in the pot.
3. Put the pot on the stove.
4. Turn on the biggest fire.
5. Wait until the water reaches rolling boil.
6. Take the eggs out of the pot.
7. Turn the fire to low, just enough to replace the heat lost by the water.
8. Let the potatoes simmer for 25 minutes.

Boiled eggs don't dirty your hand as much as raw eggs
because boiled eggs insides are solid when you crack them.

You can boil eggs, potatoes, broccoli, and other things together.
The key is to take them out at different times.

- Spatula
- Stove
****** Procedure
Wash the eggs you are going to cook.

Break the eggs onto the pan.
Tap an egg to a hard flat surface
and let the contents drop into the pan.
You can cook as many eggs as your pan can fit at once.

Turn on the stove.
Use the smallest flame.
Close the pan with a lid.

Wait until the egg white becomes opaque.

Wait a while more until it emits an aroma.

Wait a while more until the egg does not stick to the pan.
Use a spatula to test the stickiness.

Flip the egg with a spatula.
You may need to lift and tilt the pan.

Wait until you get the desired doneness.

Turn off the stove.

Eat the egg.

Let the pan cool down for a few hours.

Wash the pan.
***** Why eggs?
Pan-frying eggs takes less than 10 minutes.

Egg is a cheap protein source.
One kilogram of chicken egg contains about
130 grams of protein and costs about $2,
thus about 1.53 cents per gram of protein
(in Indonesia in May 2017).
***** What to do with the waste?
Eggshell is rich in calcium carbonate.

I don't know what to do with the eggshell waste.
**** fight
- I don't know fighting. I'm not experienced in fighting.
- Real fight

  - The opponent is non-compliant.
  - No rules, no referee, no score.

- How to attack without being countered?
  How to attack without leaving weaknesses?

  - It's impossible if both combatants are equal.

    - When A attacks B in melee combat,
      both of them bring themselves into each other's range.

- How to respond to attack?
- What if the opponent is stronger, bigger, and faster?

  - Must be prepared.
    If one is not prepared to receive the attack,
    the attack will hit.

- The best response?

  - evade and counter
  - parry/deflect and counter
  - evade
  - parry
  - accept

- Parts of body used to attack:

  - skull, fist, nail, claw, hand, elbow, knee, feet, butt.
  - If we color the region around a human according to the maximum damage he can cause,
    there will be blind spots.

- If you are close to the opponent,
  he cannot use his muscles to accelerate the bat he is holding,
  but he may bite or headbutt.
- If you are too far /or/ too close to the opponent,
  he cannot harm you.
- Attacking a prepared opponent without being countered requires a decoy.
  But what if the opponent is also prepared for the decoy...
- Fleeing is an option.

- Dental plaque will grow even if we don't eat anything.

  - The microbes eat the dead cells we shed inside the mouth.

  - nutrition
  - hypertrophy is due to microfracture healing

- How to retrain muscles killed by sitting?

  - Squatting undoes sitting damage?
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_fasciae_latae_muscle][WP:Tensor fasciae latae muscle]]

** <2016-03-22> The reason for the name spacetimecat.com
In jazz-speak, a /cat/ is a jazz musician, and
I'm a jazz musician traveling through spacetime;
hence the name /spacetime cat/.

However, most importantly, the domain is a dot-com,
and it was available, untouched by rent-seeking domain speculators.

Another reason is that the name isn't tied to shady stuffs
and doesn't have unwanted connotations.
A quick google shows that the worst result
for 'spacetime cat' is cat pictures,
which should be pretty safe for everyone
except perhaps a few extreme cat haters.

It's also nice that the name
isn't too hard to remember or spell,
but it's hard to get it wrong.

Hence I bought spacetimecat.com.

* Determining when your pants rise is too low
Your pants rise is too low if any of these are true:
- You feel your pants are cleaving your crotch.
- Your buttcrack shows when you bend over.

** Argument for killing stupid people?
- Premises:
  - People don't change.
    - Stupid is forever.
  - Survival is moral.
    If an action is necessary for survival, then it is moral.
    - Consequence: War for survival is moral.
      If there are only two people left on Earth, and there is only one last drip of water left on Earth,
      then it is moral for those people to go to war (that is, to harm the other) for that last drip of water.
    - Consequence: Retaliation is moral.
      It is moral for X to harm Y if Y harms X first.
  - Stupid people have been harming us.
- Conclusion?
  - It is moral to kill stupid people?
- Weaknesses and problems in the argument:
  - How do we define and determine stupidity?
    We should /not/ define "stupid" as "everyone who doesn't agree with us".
** Analogy: fixing wrong building, fixing wrong children, fixing wrong people?
- The safest action is preemptive strike:
  - When you realize that you built a house wrong, you tear down the house, and rebuild it the right way.
    - Or, you just wait until a natural disaster destroys it, and then rebuild it.
      - Let's hope that you aren't in the building when disaster strikes.
  - When you realize that you raised your child wrong, you kill it (?), and make another child (?).
    - Or, you just wait for karma to kill your child, and have another child.
      - Let's hope that your child doesn't kill you first.
  - If people don't change, then the only way to fix deluded people / persistently misbehaving people is killing them (?).
    - Or, you just wait for a war or disaster.
      - Let's hope that you're not in the shithole when shit happens.
  - We programmers tear down rotten code all the time.

** <2018-09-22> Derita naik Gojek/Gocar
Saya sempat coba Grab dan Gojek.
Saya tidak pakai Grab karena saya benci kode promo.
Akhirnya berlabuh di Gojek.

- Gojek
  - Kadang pengemudi tidak bisa membaca.
    Tiap minggu ada saja pengemudi yang tidak baca catatan, lalu nyasar.
    Sangat buang waktu.
  - Kadang dapat motor Yamaha Aerox.
    - Motor ini tidak aman; pusat massa tinggi, mengurangi kestabilan.
    - Motor ini tidak nyaman; joknya keras, suspensinya keras, menyiksa pantat.
    - Contoh motor yang enak: Honda Scoopy.
      Tampilannya emang culun, tapi jok lebar dan empuk, dan suspensi juga lembut.
      Enak buat pantat.
    - (Saya tidak punya motor.
      Saya bukan fans Yamaha ataupun Honda.
      Saya cuma benci sakit pantat.)
  - Kadang ban kempes.
    Kadang motor bocor.
    Kadang ban bocor.
  - Pernah, jam 17:00, 30 menit gak ada yang ambil.
- Gocar
  - Kadang pengemudi mengantuk, merem melek.
    Mobil ngegas ngerem.
  - Posisi suka ngaco.
    Minta jemput di S Parman, supir di Mal Pondok Indah lah (12 km), di Pejompongan lah (6 km), di Tomang lah (4 km), di sisi jalan yang salah lah (4 km).
  - Kadang di-cancel 5 kali baru dapat.
  - Kadang mobil bau rokok.
- Grabbike
  - <2018-10-05> Grab jam 17 sangat shitty.
    Driver tidak bisa dihubungi.
    Dua kali berturut-turut.
- Grabcar
  - <2018-10-25> Saya ditinggal kabur supir grabcar, padahal saya tinggal 5 langkah dari mobil, dan dia belum ada 5 menit menunggu.
- Aplikasi Gojek vs Grab:
  - Grab lebih reliable.
  - Gojek lebih hemat baterai.
- Perasaan saya.
  - Teknologi keduanya shitty, tapi teknologi Grab less shitty daripada teknologi Gojek;
    Grabcar lebih bisa mencari supir yang dekat (500 m, 1 km); Gocar seringkali dapat supir (2 km, bahkan pernah 6 km).
  - Supir Gocar memperlakukan penumpang lebih baik daripada supir Grabcar memperlakukan penumpang.
    Mungkin karena Gojek lebih kejam ke supir.

    - People filter incoming information.
    - People bend incoming information to conform with their preexisting beliefs.
    - Agreements polarize people, but disagreements don't depolarize people.
    - Information agreeing with preexisting belief polarize the believer.
    - Information disagreeing with preexisting belief is filtered out and doesn't depolarize the believer.

  - Key insight: We can change people's behavior without changing their beliefs.

  - Trump and Putin use "firehose of falsehood" to assert power, in the same way school bullies do.
  - The only way to take power from them is to dismiss them.
    Media should stop giving them a platform.
    We should refuse to hear them.
    We should not fact-check, because by fact-checking we affirm that they have power.
    We should simply dismiss everything they say.
    Their competitors should counter-flood the media with their own firehoses.

** Navigating social relationships?
*** Friendship
**** Abstract
Your friends are those who sacrifice for you.
The greater the sacrifice,
the greater the friendship.
How do we measure a sacrifice?
**** Measurement in theory
We define $F(A,B)$ (the /friendship measure from A to B/)
as how much sacrifice that A is willing to make for B.

(Is the direction correct? Is that backwards?)

Thus measuring friendship boils down to valuating sacrifices.

$F(A,B)$ can be approximated by an equivalent amount of money.
**** Measurement in practice
Foot-in-the-door:
let A ask B to make bigger and bigger sacrifices until B refuses.
Then we have found $F(A,B)$.

Door-in-the-face:
let A ask B to make a sacrifice so big that B refuses,
and then let A ask B to make smaller and smaller sacrifices until B accepts.
Then we have found $F(A,B)$.

Those results may differ, but $F(A,B)$ should lie somewhere between those two points.
We can also average them, take the maximum, take the minimum,
use interval arithmetics,
or describe the result using a statistical distribution, for example.
**** Properties
Friendship is circumstantial:
$F(A,B)$ changes over time.

Friendship is usually asymmetric:
$F(A,B) \neq F(B,A)$.
**** Questions
What is self-friendship?
What is $F(A,A)$?
How much is one willing to sacrifice for oneself?
Does this question even make sense?

*** Defining "boss"
- What is a boss?

  1. X is a /boss/ of Y iff X can affect Y's salary, even if X does it indirectly.
  2. X is a /strong boss/ of Y iff X has the authority to change Y's salary.
  3. X is a /weak boss/ of Y iff X is a boss, but not a strong boss, of Y.

- Example:

  - Everyone who can fire you is your strong boss.
  - Everyone who can get you fired (complain to someone who can fire you) is your weak boss.

- The stronger a boss is, the more seriously you should treat him/her.
- Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
**** Another definition, based on fear: X is a boss of Y if Y fears X.
*** Happiness
Happiness = Reality - Expectation.

To be more happy, raise reality, lower expectation, or do both.

Pain also reduces happiness.

Money cannot buy happiness,
but it can buys things that will make you happier.

Money helps, but after you have enough to make your life comfortable,
adding money doesn't add happiness.
** Fear explains everything.
There are only two ways to make people do something:
- Make them want it.
- Make them fear the consequences of not doing it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_appeal
*** Explaining love/attachment as fear of loss...
*** Intrinsic motivation to do X is fear of the consequences of not doing X.
*** To want X is to fear not getting X.
*** We eat because we fear death. We eat because we fear regretting not tasting the delicious-looking food.
*** It is the terrorists/extremists who are afraid of us, in the same way a cornered rat biting us is afraid of us?
* Spreading information in an organization
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: spreading-information-in-an-organization
  :END:

- Two choices of where we can put the burden: the seeker and the source.

  - Polling: The person who needs an information seeks the person who might have it.
    This is hard because the person who needs an information might not realize that he needs the information. "Why wasn't I informed?"
  - Reacting: The person who has an information seeks the person who might need it.
    This is hard because this requires empathy and knowing the whole organization.

    - We can't depend on people.

  - Third way: There are people who specialize in collecting information from the sources and spreading information to the seekers.

- Which of those two systems is best?

  - I think the "polling" choice is the only sane choice.
    The "reacting" choice assumes too much about human altruism.

- A computer can help, but the final burden will always be on the seeker?

  - Mixture?

- 2009, thesis, "The most effective communication channel to spread information in an organization", Susanna Ketoja, [[http://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/6736][information]], [[http://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/6736/Ketoja_Susanna.pdf][pdf]]

  - The most effective way to spread information in an organization is a combination of email and informal meetings.
* Standardizing organizations
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: standardizing-organizations
  :END:

Building an organization that builds organizations.

Building an organization operating system.

- An organization is a group, a company, a business, a non-profit, etc..
- The goal: Every organization should use the same software for operations: accounting, financing, ERP, human resource management, issue tracking, workflow.
- Every library should use the same library information system.
- The organization can focus on its core competency.
- The business operations software should be so good that every organization uses it.
* Organizing knowledge
** what
- Knowledge should be ordered descending by importance, from the most important?
- Knowledge should be ordered ascending by verifiability, from the easiest to verify?
- Knowledge should be grouped by usefulness?

  - If both Y and Z are useful to X, then Y and Z should be put together.

- Why does someone need to know something?

  - What is all the related things that he also needs to know?

- others

  - [[https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog882/l3_p3.html][Kant's Three Ways of Ordering Knowledge]]

- In what sequence should we present knowledge for fastest learning?
- Example of primitive life (but not survivalism?)

  - [[https://www.youtube.com/user/laws507/videos][YT:Primitive Life]]

- information organization

  - An information is a sentence, a paragraph, a picture, or anything that helps us accomplish something.

    - Here "information" is a countable noun.

  - Informations should be grouped by the task it helps us accomplish.

    - Every task T requires a set of informations, which should be put together in one place.
    - If doing task T requires informations J and K, then J and K should be grouped together.
    - Duplication problem.

      - Suppose: both task T and task U requires information J.
      - Where should J be put?

  - The value of information J should be measured by the ratio V/E, where V is the value of the task that J helps us accomplish, and E is our effort for obtaining J.
  - Example of combinatorial explosion of categories.

    - Which should a red car be grouped together with: a red hat or a blue car?

      - Which should a big old man be grouped together with: a big old woman, a big young man, or a small old man?

- The information organization of this wiki

  - At first I tried grouping by topic.
  - Then I asked myself, "Why am I collecting this information?"
  - Then I tried grouping by project (goals).
  - I switched from lookup-oriented knowledge organization (organize knowledge for refindability (fast lookup))
    to task-oriented (goal-oriented) knowledge organization (organize knowledge by the tasks that require the knowledge).

- Can machine organize information for us?
  Can machine cluster documents by the task they help accomplish?

* Magick
** Wanted: replicable magick experiments
- Notes?

  - The presence of the experimenter affects the result?
  - The experiments may need to be repeated many times?

- Experiment ideas, ordered from the easiest to repeat:

  - Extrasensory perception

    - Astral projection

      1. Get a person (A) who can astral-project.
      2. Generate a bit X.
      3. Ask A about X.

    - Dream precognition

      - Telepathy

        1. Get two telepathic people A and B. (If you are telepathic yourself, you can be any one of them.)
        2. Generate a bit X (0 or 1) that only you and A know.
        3. Let A telepathically tell X to B. (Take care to isolate each of you to avoid sensory leakage.)
        4. Ask B about X.

    - Spirit possession

      - Procedure:

        1. Get two mediums A and B. (If you are a medium yourself, you can be A.)
        2. Get A to summon a spirit S.
        3. Generate a bit X (0 or 1) that only you and A know.
        4. Let A tell X to S.
        5. Get S into B. (This needs more detail.)
        6. Ask the S-possessed B about X.
           If he/she consistently knows, we may have a support for dualism.
        7. Get S out of B.

      - If the experiment result is promising,
        we can test the spirit's working memory capacity
        by replacing the bit X with a string, a number, a sentence, or whatever longer.
        The only important constraint is that you need to pick an X
        that is easy to remember but hard to guess.
      - Problems:

        1. Mediation may be tiring? (Can get another medium?)
        2. Spirits may refuse to cooperate? (Can get another spirit?)

  - Joint micropsychokinesis

    - What if many people try to influence a RNG at once?
      So far experiments one person influences a RNG at a time.
      Does the effect add up?

      - Is there even any effect at all?

- We might dismiss one person for hallucinating.
  Two unrelated honest people corroborating each other are less likely to be hallucinating.
  The more people say the same thing, the more serious the claim is.
  Not necessarily more true, but surely more serious.
  Most people are not pathological liars.

  - The facts may be correct, but the explanation may be unjustified.

* 2018 article "How the Internet went wrong in 15 steps"
How the Internet went wrong in 15 steps
http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/04/an-apology-for-the-internet-from-the-people-who-built-it.html
- "Step 1: Start With Hippie Good Intentions"
- "Step 4: [...] we paid a high price for keeping [the Internet] free"
  - "To avoid charging for the internet — while becoming fabulously rich at the same time — Silicon Valley turned to digital advertising."
  - Click maximization breeds sensationalism and extremism: /anything goes/, for a click.
    - Growth at all costs.
      Growth for the sake of growth.
      Idolization of growth.
      Growth is overrated.
      Growth isn't always desirable.
  - Tristan Harris: "We cannot afford the advertising business model. The price of free is actually too high.
    It is literally destroying our society, because it incentivizes automated systems that have these inherent flaws.
    Cambridge Analytica is the easiest way of explaining why that’s true.
    Because that wasn’t an abuse by a bad actor — that was the inherent platform.
    The problem with Facebook is Facebook."
- "Step 5: Everything was designed to be really, really addictive.
 The social-media giants became 'attention merchants', bent on hooking users no matter the consequences.
 'Engagement' was the euphemism for the metric, but in practice it evolved into an unprecedented machine for behavior modification."
  - Guillaume Chaslot: "The way AI is designed will have a huge impact on the type of content you see.
    For instance, if the AI favors engagement, like on Facebook and YouTube, it will incentivize divisive content, because divisive content is very efficient to keep people online."
- Internet business model that is not advertising
  - "Step 12: To fix it, we’ll need a new business model. Maybe [...] like charging users for goods and services"
  - I think Facebook/Twitter/Reddit/YouTube can make country-level subscription that countries pay using taxpayer money.
- "Step 14: Maybe nothing will change."
- What people say
  - Tim Berners-Lee: "The fact that power is concentrated among so few companies has made it possible to weaponize the web at scale."
  - Tim Cook: "I don’t have a kid, but I have a nephew that I put some boundaries on. There are some things that I won’t allow; I don’t want them on a social network."
  - Chamath Palihapitiya: "The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse, no cooperation; misinformation, mistruth. This is not about Russians’ ads. This is a global problem."

* Maximizing lithium-ion battery life
- https://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries
  - "Exposing the battery to high temperature and dwelling in a full state-of-charge for an extended time can be more stressful than cycling."
  - "In terms of longevity, the optimal charge voltage is 3.92V/cell."
  - "Every 70mV drop in charge voltage lowers the usable capacity by about 10%."
  - "Partial charging negates the benefit of Li-ion in terms of high specific energy."
  - "Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, reports that using a reduced charge level of 50% SOC increases the lifetime expectancy of the vehicle Li-ion battery by 44–130%."
  - "For safety reasons, many lithium-ions cannot exceed 4.20V/cell."
  - "Industrial devices, such as the EV, typically limit the charge to 85% and discharge to 25% to prolong battery life."
    - "Why Mobile Phone Batteries do not last as long as an EV Battery" https://batteryuniversity.com/index.php/learn/article/why_mobile_phone_batteries_do_not_last_as_long_as_an_ev_battery
  - "The question is asked, “Should I disconnect my laptop from the power grid when not in use?”
    Under normal circumstances this should not be necessary because charging stops when the Li-ion battery is full.
    A topping charge is only applied when the battery voltage drops to a certain level.
    Most users do not remove the AC power, and this practice is safe."
    - "Always keep the airflow unobstructed when running electric devices with air-cooling on a bed or pillow."
* Causal inference and machine learning
- Judea Pearl 2018 article "Theoretical Impediments to Machine Learning With Seven Sparks from the Causal Revolution" summarizes
seven tasks that causal modeling can do but current machine learning can't.
https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04016
** It would be interesting to combine Schmidhuber et al.'s algorithmic probability/universal intelligence and Pearl et al.'s causal modeling.
* If you are going to hire me
- No work for hire.
  I own all my work.
  No exceptions.
  Work-for-hire is legal exploitation.
  However, I'm open to licensing negotiations.
- I don't care about deadlines.
  It's done when I think it's done.
  I don't care about the short-term.
  I don't have a good relationship with time.
- I do what I want how I want, unless there is a reason not to.
- I won't use any language less than Prolog.
  I'm not settling for anything less.
  I insist on using the best tool I know.
  If someday I find a better tool than Prolog, I will move again.
- I only make sure that my software runs on a recent Debian release.
  I don't care if my software doesn't run on Windows, Android, or iOS.
- I can change my mind at any time.

Perhaps I should hire you, not the other way around?
** Why work for/with me? How am I from other partners/employers?
- Justice
- Fairness
- Environment
- Reasonable

Really?
Am I still the same person when I wrote that?
** Why not work for/with me?
- I can't guarantee that you will get rich working for/with me.
- I am opinionated and principled. I do things my way.
- I am a dictator, although I try to be benevolent.
** Principles?
- Survive.
- Sustain: minimize operation and minimize maintenance.
- Systems, not heroes.
  - But we need heroes?
* My company rules? My business rules?
All compensations must be explicit, rule-based, and justifiable.
Everyone must know the same rules.
Everyone must play by the same rules.
No tipping.

- Employer may terminate an employment at any time without notice.
- Employee may terminate his/her employment at any time without notice.
- Pay with money only.
  No bullshit perks and benefits.

my accounting principles?

- Keep only one book.
  Don't show different books to different people.
- Accounting records historical truth.
  Don't calculate current market price in accounting reports; mark-to-market belongs in financial statements, not accounting books.
- Don't mix currencies.
- A redenominated currency is a different currency.
- Err on the side of safety.
  Don't count your eggs before they hatch.
  Recognize income as late as possible.
  Recognize expenses as early as possible.

** Technology for anarchy: redistributing power back from government to the people
- Food-backed currency: $1 means the right to one meal.
- Distributed electricity generation
*** Anarchy
- distributed web browser, hosting, and operating system
- currency that is backed by food

You should not reap what you don't sow.

You should not be entitled what you don't earn.
If you don't work, you should not be paid.
Abolish inheritance.

You should not be liable for what is not your fault.
If you are born disabled, it's not your fault.

But how can you work if you are disabled?
*** Technology for anarchy?
How do you host something without being liable for it?
For example, someone uploads porn to your distributed network.

Encryption-at-rest, and in transit, with tamper-resistant private key that self-destructs readily?

Even simpler.
Split the file into several parts, and host each part in different host.
Sorites paradox.
At how many bytes does a file contain porn?
If everyone is a criminal, then nobody is a criminal.

Currency tied to food price.
A meal should be nutritious and nourishing and healthy.
$1 = 1 meal.
Labor that enables the meal.
$1 = cooking 5 meals.
The cook creates a value of $5 but gets paid only $1.
Let everything be market.
$? = Creating a technology that enables us to make more meals.
$1 = protection for 8 hours.
How should we value art, programming, etc.? Let the market decide!
How does software enable us to create more meals?

If everyone takes more value than they create, the system collapses.

Cloud hosting is not a solution.
It's still centralized.
Your cloud provider decides what to host.
Government can crack cloud providers down.
*** Distributed-web browser?
Let's write a web browser library in Prolog.

2018-12-17 Tumblr bans all adult content.

We need a web that cannot be controlled.

https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/11/indonesia-737-crash-caused-by-safety-feature-change-pilots-werent-told-of/

Sensor error is more likely than actual stall?
The designers trust themselves more than they trust the pilots?
The pilots didn't read the manual?
Boeing didn't disseminate information fast enough?
Hardware fault?

* Important vs urgent
Something is important if not doing it is fatal.
Breathing, eating, drinking water.
Having some in-demand high-paying skills.
Being useful.

Something is urgent if it urges you to do it, if you feel an urge (strong desire) to do it.
Eating sugar, fucking, shitting.
* Senior, lead, manager, director
Etymology.

Senior = older.
https://www.etymonline.com/word/senior

Lead = to show the way.
https://www.etymonline.com/word/lead#etymonline_v_6615

Manage = handle or train a horse.
https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=manage

Handle = "touch with the hands, hold in the hands, fondle, pet"
https://www.etymonline.com/word/handle

You must know what you want. Nobody can know it for you.

A director /directs/.
A director knows what he/she wants.
Don't let the inmates run the asylum.
CEOs should be engineers.
Politicians should be engineers.

<2018-12-12>
I changed my opinion.
Politicians should not exist.
* Birth is not survival.
To survive is to keep/continue living.

Survival of the individual vs survival of the species?

Survivalism is compatible with antinatalism.
* Law
- Law should be principle-based instead of rule-based.
- A judge should facilitate restoration, not determine punishment.
* Programming language?
2006, "A growable language"
"programming language designers should plan for such growth, along with the growth of a user community"
https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1176621
* Databases? Designing databases?

What Datomic brings to businesses
https://medium.com/@val.vvalval/what-datomic-brings-to-businesses-e2238a568e1c
interesting: inherent versioning, internally log-structured, internally append-only
My only objection: database should be a library, not a separate operating system process.

https://augustl.com/blog/2018/datomic_look_at_all_the_things_i_am_not_doing/

Database design boils down to this question:
- how do we store (arrange, lay out) data on disk?
- how do we make the database replicate automatically just by adding a node to a cluster?
  etcd?

Why do we store data?
Because we will need it later.
- accounting
- As a person, I don't need convenience store receipts. But a company needs them for accounting.

It has to be findable/discoverable/rediscoverable.
* Philosophy?
Bertrand Russell - Message To Future Generations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihaB8AFOhZo
* Cops, government, and you
Cops don't work for you. They work for the government.

The government doesn't work for you. They work for themselves.
Only people with entitlement mentality thinks the government works for them.
* Ramble about programming
Computers feel slow not because hardware sucks, but because programmers tell it to do stupid things.
Ever-stronger hardware lets more programmers get away with writing ever-shittier software.
* Math, learning, and brain?
https://dyske.com/paper/825
"When I was in 7th grade, my math teacher answered an obvious but difficult question:
Why do we have to study advanced math, if we are never going to use it in our adult lives?
He said it’s because the same parts of our brains used for math can be used for many other things in life.
With this short explanation, he utterly convinced me the importance of studying math, and of any other subjects for that matter."
* Altruism with high impact-to-effort ratio
https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/
* Code of conduct
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't do things that you don't want to be done to you.
* Ramble: What is programming language expressivity?
What if we define language expressivity this way?

"J-expressive" means "expressive with respect to language J (judge)"

Language S (strong) is more J-expressive than language W (weak) iff the shortest interpreter for J in S is shorter than the shortest interpreter for J in W, without caring about speed.

Language A is more complex than language B iff A is more B-expressive than B is A-expressive.

Prolog is simple to reason but hard to implement?
Java is hard to reason but simple to implement?
It is easier to write Prolog interpreter in Java than to write Java interpreter in Prolog.
But how does Prolog's simplicity enables us to write better programs?
If a language is more complex, shouldn't it be more expressive/powerful?
What is the relationship between complexity, expressivity, and power?
What is expressivity?

I can make a language more complex without adding expressivity, by adding features that don't fit with the language?

* Gaining information by losing data?
(Do I understand what I'm talking about?)

It is possible to gain information while losing data.
We often gain information when we feed data to an irreversible function.
Example:
- array_length
- statistical summarization and interpretation
- modeling
But is that losing data?

Most interesting mappings are irreversible.
Modeling is irreversible mapping.
* "Investing"
What Bitcoin "investing" is:
- You buy a certificate of environmental destruction from someone, probably a "miner".
- You expect a greater fool to buy that certificate from you at a higher price.
  There are millions of other people who are looking for someone else more stupid than them.

Bitcoin is massive wealth transfer from late buyers to early buyers.
All financial investing is massive "realistic-return" Ponzi scheme.
Exactly fits the definition.
Newcomers pay oldtimers.
Late buyers pay early buyers.

Bitcoin is not necessary at all. It is pure want.
Inflation target disincentivizes currency hoarding.
A deflating currency encourages currency hoarding and discourages real spending.

* Sleeping? Too tired to dream?
https://www.quora.com/Can-you-be-too-tired-to-dream

Sleeping requires that we release conscious control of all voluntary muscles.

Why can't we sleep with running thoughts?
* Software, art?
If software is a pure art, then its construction shouldn't be time-limited.

A painter doesn't paint with deadlines.
A painting is finished when the painter feels it's finished.

However, a painter, when asked to paint a very specific painting, can estimate how many days it will take.
* People who have too much time
This decision problem is solvable in Perl "regular" expressions: Given A, B, C, determine whether A + B = C.
- https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9d768u/i_know_its_ridiculous_but_i_just_made_a_regex_in/
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9tj6h6/remember_that_abc_regex_i_felt_it_wasnt/
- It uses capturing groups and backreferences, and therefore it is not a regular expression.

Right is given by one person to others.

* If you win a lottery
Don't tell anyone.
Even families, friends, and lovers.
* Buy shoes.
My needs:
- Comfortable for walking and running long distance.
- Zero maintenance, and won't break in 100 years, especially the insole.
  No cleaning, polishing, semir, whatever.
  - ? https://samuraiinsoles.com/
- What insole material?
  - plastic
  - metal
  - stone
  - aerogel
  - memory foam
  - graphene (strong but elastic)
    - http://www.kicksguide.com/top-5-materials-used-to-make-shoes/
      - "leather untreated can be vulnerable to water damage"
        - surely the leather is treated first?
      - "Because the material is less durable than its leather and textile counterparts, however, synthetic shoes tend to degrade faster and need replacing more often."
    - https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-durable-shoe-brands-for-men
      - "Look for a shoe that is (1) all leather.
        I found the man-made soles and outsoles to be the first thing to deteriorate.
        And (2) handmade."

  - https://www.quora.com/What-material-is-the-best-for-the-sole-of-shoes
My options:
- Self-reinforce the soles with double-tapes or FlexTape/FlexSeal/FlexShot/window glue.
  This risks uneven shoe heights and compensating gait which may be pathological in the long-term.
- Repair/reinforce the current shoes at tukang sol sepatu.
- Buy Dr Martens guaranteed shoes at GI.
  But what if that store goes bust?
  What are the terms of the guarantee?
  How long is the wait time?
  Will the replacement be the same product?
- Buy army surplus shoes as Abdullah did.
- Cobble my own shoes.
- Just buy new shoes every year.
- Buy many shoes at once, and rotate them.
  - Does it work? Why?
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/IsItBullshit/comments/2ryyzg/isitbullshit_rotating_pairs_of_shoes_makes_them/
  - https://www.quora.com/Does-rotating-leather-shoes-make-them-last-longer
  - If a shoe lasts 3 years, and I have 60 more years to wear shoes, then I should buy 20 pairs of shoes right now and rotate them?
    - Wouldn't those shoes rot in my home?
- It's safer to buy 20 pairs of average shoes than 1 pair of expensive shoes.
  If shit happens, you still get 19 pairs, instead of nothing at all.
- What else?

Bad journalism.

* Clojure maps are applicable like functions.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
({:a 1 :b 2 :c 3} :a)
=> 1
({:a 1 :b 2 :c 3} :b)
=> 2
#+END_SRC

Clojure has nice map syntax: =(m k)= for accessing k.

Maps are isomorphic to functions.
We update a map.
Updating a function is simple:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
update nk nv f = \ k -> if k == nk then nv else f k
-- and then beta-normalize the lambda body
#+END_SRC

A Prolog deterministic binary predicate is like a Clojure map.
* What programming language should we use?
<2018-12-11>
My current answer: Prolog.

My previous answers:
- Haskell
- Racket
- Scheme
- Java
- C
- C++

Other people?

* Economics, price, quality
Price is not important in itself.
It is the quality-price trade-off that is important.
People don't buy shit even if it's cheap, even if you pay them to buy it.

For an increment of quality, people are willing to pay an increment of price.
But there is a "good enough" point where people are satisfied and they just look at the lowest price.

Negative price means willingness to pay to get rid of something.
Example: rotten vegetables has negative price to most people, but positive price to farmers.

CPU tidak mentok, RAM tidak mentok, berarti ada beberapa kemungkinan:
- bottleneck di network,
- CPU di-throttle oleh docker/cgroup,
- bottleneck di disk seek rate (unnecessary SQL transaction),
- bottleneck di disk transfer rate.

    - We can see a relation from \( A \) to \( B \) as a function from \( A \) to \( 2^B \).
      - Every binary relation \((A,B,r)\) is a function \((A,2^B,f)\)
        where \(f(x) = \{ y ~\|~ r(x,y) \}\).
    - Which is more primitive: function or relation?

* Company value extraction efficiency
Company value extraction efficiency = gross revenue attributable to employee labor / expenses attributable to employees

Amount stolen = profit = revenue - wage

Extraction efficiency = Amount stolen / wage

"Profit comes from the worth of the workers' labor minus their wage.
The difference is what is stolen."

If a capitalist finds better things for a worker to do, then:
- Is the capitalist entitled to the profits?
- Is the worker entitled to the profits?

The image is nonsensical, but the writing is sound.

* Language issues
A bean is a plant.

Let B be an individual, a bean plant.

Every individual of the species Solanum tuberosum is a plant.

A potato tree is a plant.
A potato is not a plant; a potato is a tuber.
Potato the whole plant vs potato the edible tuber

* Traumatic experiences, and things I learned the hard way
** <2018-10-08> While a person is on a motorcycle (be it driving or not driving), he must secure his chattels, and not place them in shirt pockets, in order to prevent the chattels from falling to the road (therefore being lost or broken).
- Secure the chattels:
  - Put it in a /totally closed compartment/ in a bag, not in a pocket on the bag.
  - Grip the chattels.
- Triggers:
  - Eyeglasses fell from shirt pocket to the road, and were run over by the motorcycle behind.
  - A few months ago, a hairband fell from bag pocket to the road; it was lost.
  - Shit happened. Twice.

Should we just use Opa or Ur/Web?
Which should we use, Opa or Ur/Web?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opa_(programming_language)
"It can be used for both client-side and server-side scripting, where complete programs are written in Opa and subsequently compiled to Node.js on the server and JavaScript on the client, *with the compiler automating all communication between the two*." (emphasis mine)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur_(programming_language)
"[...] from a single program produces server code, browser client code and SQL code specific for the chosen database backend."

We don't need to create a new surface syntax. We can shallow-embed the DSL in Ocaml.

We need a new surface syntax if we want to generate routing data structure at compile time. The choice for the data structures are:
- We can use a hash table.
- We can use a prefix tree.

- Stages of academic productivity:
    - You don't build on any past work. You start things and abandon them soon after. You redo your own work. You redo others' work without knowing it.
    - You know other people' work, but pride prevents you from even considering to study that work. You want to reinvent everything.
    - You learn to build on your past work.
    - You study other people's work, but you think you can do better.
    - You learn to build on other people's work.
    - You look for others who might share your interests.
    - You don't care whether it's you or someone else who solves the research problem. All you want is to see it solved.

You write a parser in C.
You rewrite the parser in Scheme.
You rewrite the parser again in Haskell.
Then you search for the essence of programming.
Then you stop writing parsers.
Now you write the grammar instead, and find a way to generate the parser from the grammar.
You also look for a way to generate the pretty printer from the grammar.
You find Prolog.

External type checking in the style of Erlang Dialyzer.

A type checker is a function from AST to Extended AST.

Resource should be freed as soon as it is not used.

How should we think of compile-time checking?
- Compile-time errors /predicts/ runtime errors.
- Compile-time errors /preclude/ runtime errors.

Type checking is a special case of program checking.

https://medium.com/@daveford/what-i-want-in-a-type-system-1316a78365b


Compile-time is a model of runtime. We don't model hardware errors.

Using DCG to parse CST

The principle: the rules must incorporate the parsed input. Don't remove information.

I changed my mind.
Write a DCG metainterpreter that adds location data to the token stream.
Separate the concerns.

"Separating concerns with metainterpreters" may be a worthy talk.

"Separating cross-cutting concerns with Prolog metainterpreters"

A CST node is either F(Code) or F(Child1, ..., ChildN) where
F is a functor and each ChildK is a CST node
and Code is a character code
An error node is error(Message, A, B)
It means that the parser encounters an error and resyncs to B
A is the offending subinput

exp(plus(M, N)) :- ...
exp(number(F,R)) :- ...
exp(digit(D)) :- ...

Use [plus,M,N] instead of plus(M,N)
Comments

data CST = Space Char | Digit Char | Number CST CST | Plus CST CST | Error Msg CST CST

exp :: String -> CST

It is possible to reconstruct the input string from the CST.


What is the difference between Scheme match library and ML pattern matching?

Experiment

A=[1,2],append(A,B,C) infinite
B=[1,2],append(A,B,C) infinite
C=[1,2],append(A,B,C) infinite
In order for C to be length-ground when append/3 exits:
- A and B are length-ground, or
- C is length-ground.
append(A,B,C)

S ::= <empty> | S a
s(A) :- append([S0,[0'a],S1],A), s(S0), s(S1).



- A terminal cannot be empty.
- Each right-hand side must contain at least one terminal.
  We require that every rule consume at least one character.
  This is so that the recursion is always decreasing.
- The generated parser requires that the input be length-ground.
  If the input is not length-ground, the parser may not terminate.

Prolog for computing taxes.
- https://github.com/cbbrowne/canadiantaxes
  - It uses dynamic predicates.

Software requirement does not change?
It is we who failed to discover the requirement?
It is we who failed to discover the underlying reality?
But how do we distinguish between design and overengineering?

* Economics?
We should measure debt-to-income ratio instead of debt-to-GDP ratio?

Consumptive debt sacrifices future for the present.

Productive debt is good.

Example of productive debt:

Suppose that you want to buy a land to farm on it. These are the scenarios:
- You work for 20 years. Then you buy the land with cash. But the land price has risen.
- You take a loan, buy the land now, and repay the loan over 10 years. In the second year, your land starts producing.

If a person takes too much consumptive debt, he goes bankrupt.

If a government takes too much consumptive debt nominated in its own currency, it can print money to repay the debt, but such printing devalues the currency.

If the US continues to take loans mindlessly, it will have to choose:
- Default (refuse to repay).
- Suffer severe inflation (rising prices), if the creditors spend the printed money.

Does the USA think it can get away by refusing to repay its debts? It will trigger a huge power shift, maybe to China. Will China sacrifice itself to clean up America's mess? Will China buy up all US debts, and use the default as a reason to start a war?

Everything comes from nature.
We are not creating or destroying anything.
We are merely transforming things.
At least as seen from physics.

The number of atoms in Earth doesn't change.
(But what about solar wind? It does change a bit?)

Urban toilet harms humans and the Earth.
- We should poo squatting, not sitting.
- Urine and feces should be composted, not flushed down the drain.
- Compost bins should replace septic tanks.

* Statistics, smoking, mindfulness
Seeing statistics worries me.
Most researchers don't understand statistics.
For example, I don't need statistics to know that smoking is bad; it's obvious.
It smells bad.
It makes me dizzy.

I guess people smoke because they have peer pressure, they have a weird sense of "cool", and they are too lazy to think for themselves.

Smoking always tastes bad.
Thus it is the rationalization that makes smokers tough it out.

How to stop smoking (Does it work?)

Remember when you first smoke cigarettes.
This is my guess.
It tastes bitter.
You cough.
Your eyes water.
It hurts.
But you tough it out.
You fear that your friends will leave you if you don't smoke.

I want you to taste every cigarette in the same way you tasted your first cigarette.
It's always the first time.
Feel the unpleasant bitter taste.
* The only way to change your adult son is to make him angry at himself.
I've been looking at fit boys and girls.

I'm reasonably average.
I don't have rare diseases.

The question is whether I /will/, not whether I /can/.
Of course I /could/; I just /wouldn't/.

My fucking mind invents various fucking excuses:

- I'll do it later.
- it's not good to exercise right before bedtime.

The key is to be /angry at yourself/.
A little self-hate is necessary.
Self-acceptance doesn't mean "give up and suck forever": this is defeatism.
Self-acceptance also doesn't mean "I'm beautiful and it's their problem if I'm fat":
this is entitlement mentality; this is delusion; this is not anchored on objective reality.

Imagine you're a boss, and you have this one guy who always come up with excuses.
Fucking fire him. He is you. Fire yourself. Now. Get fucking angry already.

Anger (but not rage) is necessary.
A person who never gets angry doesn't really want to live.
It is impossible to not get angry in the 21st century.
Everything is shitty.
Software is bloated, slow, and unreliable.
Governments are too big and wasteful.
Your job sucks.
Your children are good for nothing.
Your food is poisonous.
Religions murder people and hamper scientific progress.
Pandering politicians promise unfundable imaginary benefits.
What the fuck is going on?
Why the fuck do we let this happen?
Why aren't we angry?
