  - What is the difference between variable and parameter?
  - How many parameters do we need to model a system?
  - Discrete Newtonian kinematical model
    - A /system at time \( t \)/ is a set of particles ( { 1, \ldots, n } ).
      - Time is a real number: \( t \in \Real \).
      - The number of particle is constant \( n \in \Nat \).
      - For each particle \( k \):
        - It has /position/ \( x_k \in \Real^3 \).
        - Simplifying assumptions
          - particle
            - It is a point.
              - It doesn't occupy any space.
            - Its mass is not modeled.
          - Time is global and absolute (the same everywhere).
  - Discrete Newtonian dynamical model (N-body problem) extends discrete Newtonian kinematical model.
    - A /system at time \( t \)/ is all that above, plus:
      - For each particle \( k \):
        - It has /mass/ \( m_k \in \Real \).
        - It has /resultant force/ \( F_k \) acting on it.
        - Simplifying assumptions about the particle
          - It is rigid.
            - It doesn't deform.
            - It doesn't break.
          - Its mass is constant.
          - It don't interact with other particles.
            - Particles don't merge or collide.

** Common company wiki fundamental problem
- Employees have no reason to read the wiki.
- It doesn't help them do their jobs.
  - Why should they read it then?
** Library problems
  - In 2018, a lot of human knowledge is still in libraries and not available on the Internet.
    Digital typesetting was invented relatively recently.
    Papers should be scanned and OCR-ed.
    AI can help.
  - Why are there different libraries?
    There should be only one library in the world.
    All library should be the same.
    All library should have the same content.

- Evolutionary ethics
    - Morality is shaped by evolution.
    - We have difficulties defining what is "good", but there are things that we agree are good.
    - Morality is defined by the majority opinion.
    - Humans evolved morality because morality promotes survival.
        - Nature selects moral behavior. There is evolutionary pressure for moral behavior.
            - Sharing foods promotes survival.
            - Sharing knowledge promotes survival.
            - Cooperation promotes survival.
            - Marriage promotes survival?
            - Monogamy promotes survival?
    - The morality of a species is whatever evolved behavior that promotes its survival.

  - Learning languages, both human languages and programming languages
    - One learns a language by example sentences.
      One learns a programming language by example programs/snippets.

* Government/state
** Deregulation of USA

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuAg-RaZ4Is][Trump Is 'Destroying' Regulations - YouTube]]

Trump needs a cooperative Congress in order for him to be able to repeal more laws.

** Antonin Scalia: The key to American freedom is the separation of power, not the Bill of Rights.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ggz_gd--UO0

The USSR Constitution guarantees more freedom than the USA Constitution, but the USSR failed to prevent the centralization of power.

Every dictatorship has bill of rights.

North Korea has elections.

** Evolution justifies governments

Evolution suggests that cooperation improves survival (in the long run, of the species, not of an individual).

Evolution suggests that morality improves survival.

Evolution suggests that government improves survival.

What is the state for?
Why do we need government?
To promote the survival of the governed species.

*** Government is not to merely maintain public order.

Public order can be undesirable:

- We don't want a government that oppresses people in order to maintain public order.
- The overthrowing of a tyrant may be a desirable public disorder.

To promote survival of the people? As in evolution?

To better the people?
To impose the morality of the people?
A government reflects the morality of its people.

We must impose our morality on others.
The law imposes the lawmakers' morality on everyone.
It is practically impossible to live without imposing your morality on others.
There is a minimum decency that we expect when we interact with others.

The enforcement of law is an imposition of the morality of the lawmakers (and therefore of the people who elected the lawmakers).

https://www.quora.com/Should-the-law-impose-morality

*** Social apoptosis? Programmed human death?

Some cells must die to better the organism.
Some people should die to better the society?
Programmed cell death ~ programmed human death?

A malfunctioning cell kills itself.
It would be nice if a malfunctioning human could kill himself?

A cell infected by a virus kills itself.
It would be nice if a human infected by ideological virus (mind virus) could kill himself?

How do we know we're infected?

*** Why should our survival be desirable at all?

*** Human rights are legal fiction.

What is real is tolerance.
People let other people live.
If I am still alive, it's because others let me live,
because others tolerate me,
not because I have any rights.

* Pragmatic ontology: how pragmatism can help us answer what something is

(Is this really what others mean by "pragmatic ontology"?)

To the pragmatic ontologist, "exist" means "practically exist".

Someone who subscribes to egocentric pragmatic ontology would take the question "What is X?" to mean "What can I use X for? / How can I use X?"

- I can use it, therefore it exists. (Compare: Descartes's "I think, therefore I exist.")
- It affects me, therefore it exists.

* The dualistic nature of machines; the machine-program dualism; the hardware-software dualism

The hardware is the body.
The software is the mind.

Are bits software /itself/, or are bits a /representation/ (embodiment) of software?

A running machine embodies the software it is running?

* Defining investing, trading, gambling, betting, wagering, insurance
** Defining gambling
We say that a person /gambles/ iff he bets on an outcome that he doesn't know how to control at all.

Thus, there are two necessary conditions for something to be a gamble:
- There exists a bet.
- There does not exist control.

Other definitions of gambling:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling
- US legal definition https://definitions.uslegal.com/g/gambling/
** How do we know something is not gambling?
*** If it's possible to be skillful, then it's not gambling.
** What
- Investing
- Trading
- Betting
- Random/uncontrollable
- Individual outcome is unpredictable

Can two unskilled people playing chess control the outcome?

Wager and bet are synonyms.

The gambler doesn't have /any/ control over the outcome of a gamble.
How do we know if someone has some control? The ability to affect outcome. By how much? By physical explanation?
Too hard to predict?

The gamblers are gambling, but the casino isn't.
The casino can control the outcome.

Although the individual outcomes are unpredictable, the trend is predictable.

Insurance is reverse gambling, which is also gambling.
It is absurd to buy something that you avoid using.

- "What makes gambling wrong but insurance right?" https://www.bbc.com/news/business-38905963
- https://seekingalpha.com/article/4080260-insurance-gambling-seriously
  - "Insurance is a very specific type of gambling."
  - "Two parties agree on the consideration (by calling that wager a premium instead),
    the type of chance (by using expectations of when the insured might die, for example),
    and a prize (by referring to the winnings as a death benefit)."

Can you insure yourself against loss at the casino?

Is professional poker gambling?
If a skilled player can consistently beat an unskilled player, than the skilled player can control the outcome, and thus the skilled player is not gambling.

If skill (improvement) is possible, then it isn't gambling.

Can you be skilled in throwing dice so that you can consistently beat unskilled people?
Slot machines?
Guessing computer-generated numbers?
What is a possible physical explanation?

How do we argue that binary option is gambling?

I saw binary options marketed with fake Facebook comments.
I know those Facebook comments are fake because all of them have perfect grammar, capitalization, and punctuation.
Real Facebook comment threads are full of shit.

  - However, Jordan Peterson says that inequality is not due to capitalism, but because small successes breeds even bigger successes.
    - When something good happens to you, it increases the probability that something else good also happens to you.

  - Reduce the TIME_WAIT MSL (maximum segment lifetime)

** Why the non-oppressed Chinese must help the oppressed Chinese

Because when the oppressed people revolt, the non-oppressed people will be among the victims.

*** Speculations

These are the possible scenarios:
- The oppressed thinks that they are already dead (their lives are worse than death) anyway,
  musters enough strength, revolts, and overthrows the government.
  The non-oppressed (the middle-class) takes collateral damage.
- The government kills off all oppressed people.
  The non-oppressed people lives in their bubble happily ever after.
- The government slowly releases control while trying to save face.

Xi Jinping cannot release control in 2018, because if he releases control, his opponents will pounce on him, reveal all his crimes, and tarnish his name.
Xi Jinping wants to die in good standing, with good reputation; he wants to be remembered as a good person.

I hope that the next bloodshed gives the Chinese people enough reason to limit government power.

You can live a good comfortable life in China as long as you blind yourself from the truth.

Stalin's inner circle was too afraid to tell him the truth.

https://www.quora.com/Is-is-true-that-top-Soviet-officials-lived-in-constant-fear-under-Stalin-Or-is-that-an-exaggeration

After Stalin died, there was a great purge.

You know your country is led by an authoritarian if:
- You can't say the truth there.
- There is someone whom people are too afraid to disagree with, even politely.

We must respect the truth.
The truth doesn't care about us.
People who ignore the truth do so at their own peril.
Ignoring the truth means ignoring some danger;
such ignorance reduces the chance of survival.

** <2018-09-24> Competition is wasteful

Suppose that Company A and Company B both make System S.
They duplicate each other's efforts.
Then Company B loses.
Thus everything B (and all other losers) did is /wasted/.

- If a company doesn't have any competitors, it has little incentive to improve.
  (We assume that companies only improve when they are existentially threatened.)
- How do we make sure that something improves even without competition?
  /Guilds/.
  An organization that /intrinsically/ wants to improve (while still profiting),
  not an organization that intrinsically wants to maximize profit at all costs.

*** Should we assume scarcity or abundance?

- Which assumption is better?
  - Assumption of scarcity: Human always wants more than what exists. There is never enough resources for everybody.
  - Assumption of abundance: There is a point where humans are satisfied. There are enough resources for everybody.

I think the assumption of abundance is saner.

An economy consists of actors.

Hypotheses:

- Shocks ripple through actors.
- Demand collapse may waste inventory.

*** Uncertainty in hiring
In hiring, if a candidate leaves good impressions (not exceptional, but decent nonetheless), but you aren't sure about him, should you just reject him?
Does "maybe" mean "no"?
*** To avoid wasting time, begin with the most selective test.
Begin with the test with the highest failure ratio.
End the interview as soon as the candidates fail the test.
Respect their time and your time.
Don't force them to do what they can't do well.
Don't set them up to fail.
If you aren't going to hire them, don't waste their time.
*** Recruitment pipeline
- Review the resume / curriculum vitae.
*** You know your job ad is wrong when...
You know your job ad is wrong when you have to obviously reject a lot of candidates without thinking.

* Donald Trump, firehose of lies, psychology
** https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/ is a firehose of lies.

* Insane stuffs
** Argument for killing stupid people?
- Premises:
  - People don't change.
    - Stupid is forever.
  - Survival is moral.
    If an action is necessary for survival, then it is moral.
    - Consequence: War for survival is moral.
      If there are only two people left on Earth, and there is only one last drip of water left on Earth,
      then it is moral for those people to go to war (that is, to harm the other) for that last drip of water.
    - Consequence: Retaliation is moral.
      It is moral for X to harm Y if Y harms X first.
  - Stupid people have been harming us.
- Conclusion?
  - It is moral to kill stupid people?
- Weaknesses and problems in the argument:
  - How do we define and determine stupidity?
    We should /not/ define "stupid" as "everyone who doesn't agree with us".
** Analogy: fixing wrong building, fixing wrong children, fixing wrong people?
- The safest action is preemptive strike:
  - When you realize that you built a house wrong, you tear down the house, and rebuild it the right way.
    - Or, you just wait until a natural disaster destroys it, and then rebuild it.
      - Let's hope that you aren't in the building when disaster strikes.
  - When you realize that you raised your child wrong, you kill it (?), and make another child (?).
    - Or, you just wait for karma to kill your child, and have another child.
      - Let's hope that your child doesn't kill you first.
  - If people don't change, then the only way to fix deluded people / persistently misbehaving people is killing them (?).
    - Or, you just wait for a war or disaster.
      - Let's hope that you're not in the shithole when shit happens.
  - We programmers tear down rotten code all the time.
    We rewrite it from scratch.
    Why don't we tear down rotten societies as well?
* Thinking
** Weapons enable oppression.
- Weapons enhance our ability to kill.
  - Weapons enhance our ability to scare.
  - Thus weapons enhance our ability to oppress.
- Order of magnitude of weapon oppression effectiveness
  - With a blade, one person can oppress 1 person.
  - With a pistol, one person can oppress 10 people.
  - With a machine gun, one person can oppress 100 people.
  - With a bomb such as that in Oklahoma city bombing, one person can oppress 1,000 people.
  - With a nuclear bomb such as those dropped by the USA on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War 2, one person can oppress 1,000,000 people.
- Order of magnitude of media deception effectiveness?
  - This is totally baseless.
    How do we estimate this?
  - With hearsay, one person can deceive ten people?
  - With paper, one person can deceive a hundred people?
  - With newspaper or WhatsApp, one person can deceive a million people?
  - With television or Facebook or Google, one person can deceive a hundred million people?
- The only way for the oppressed to fight back is:
  - total guerrilla warfare
  - living near to the oppressor (so that he can't nuke)
  - terrorism
    - Is there really no other way?
      Dialogs?
      Referendums?

** Capitalism
- What is capitalism?

  - Capitalism is:

    1. the /private ownership/ of means of production,
    2. the operation of such means /for profit/.

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism][WP: Capitalism]].

- How is it good?

  - Capitalism enables selfish people to better everyone else.
  - Voluntary exchange betters everyone.

    - People don't agree to a deal they think bad for them.

- How is it bad?

  - Wealth gap? Social gap?
  - Capitalism places capital above labor?
  - Short-term profit-seeking and rent-seeking destroys environment and humanity?

- How can it be improved?

  - Regulation

    - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOaJe68C-bU][How to Improve Capitalism]]

  - Capitalism can be environmentally friendly if the polluters pay the environmental costs.

    - 2018: other people are still paying the cost. (Negative externality)

      - Can sustainability be made profitable?

- How does employment and slavery compare?

  - Slavery is the ownership of humans.
  - Employment is the rental of humans.
  - How has slavery changed?

    - Humans used to buy humans. Now humans rent other humans.

    - "Hiring" /is/ "renting".

      - You rent a car. The contract includes an insurance. You use the car for anything; just don't break it.
      - You hire an employee. The contract includes an insurance. You use the employee for anything; just don't break it.

    - [[http://www.differencebetween.net/business/difference-between-labor-and-human-capital/][differencebetween.net: labor and human capital]]

- Ramble

  - Companies must extract value to survive.

    - A profitable company must extract more value
      from its employees than it pays its employees.

      - People create value. People in a company create value. Human labor creates value.
        Companies aren't human. Companies can't work. It's the employees who work.
      - But if the employees weren't in the company, they might create less value.
        The company might be a place where the employees can create more value for society.

- Capital is everything that is not labor?
- Capitalism is capital above labor? Communism is labor above capital?

    - art freelancing

** Solving the Israel-Palestine problem
- I propose this for the Israel-Palestine problem:

  - Country

    - Establish a new country (say "Ispal"), merging Israel and Palestine.

  - Government

    - Everyone in the Israeli government is in the Ispalian government.
    - Everyone in the Palestinian government is in the Ispalian government.

  - Land

    - The land of Ispal is the land of Israel plus the land of Palestine.

  - Citizen

    - Every Israeli is an Ispalian.
    - Every Palestinian is an Ispalian.

  - Law

    - Every Ispalian is equal before the law.

  - Why this might not be accepted

    - Idealism, fanaticism, narrow-mindedness, intolerance, ignorance of history, mixing religion and politics

** violin
This is my study notes, observations, and conclusions.
This is a bit disorganized.

I play the violin without chin rest and shoulder rest.
*** The right pinky
The right pinky is for playing softly:
tilt the bow very slightly by pressing down the pinky (with the thumb as the fulcrum).
XXX: Is it by flexing the pinky or by supinating the hand?

Playing softly is harder than playing loudly.
Playing softly also uses more tension than playing loudly.
*** Squeaking
Each bow speed has a range of pressure that will make a good sound.
Less bow speed needs less pressure.
The symptom of too much pressure for a bow speed is squeaking;
increase the bow speed, or decrease the bow pressure, or both.

Decrease the bow pressure by pressing the end of the bow with the right pinky,
with the thumb as the fulcrum.
*** Playing open strings
Open strings, especially the A and E strings,
sound brighter than stopped strings,
so open strings will be perceived as louder
even though the bow speed and pressure stay the same.
In order to play scales with even dynamics,
we can avoid open strings,
or we can bow the open strings more softly
with reduced pressure and speed.

Also, we can play the D string nearer to the bridge to brighten it,
and the A string nearer to the fingerboard to darken it,
to make the change from the D to the A string smoother.
*** Idea for group practice
Learning Kreutzer etudes together?
*** Bouncing bows
The hairs act as a spring.

Vertical component of stick-slip.

Act as torque with the right thumb as the fulcrum.
** wikia

** Self-care, grooming, health, fitness
*** crisis
**** Disclaimer
This is my opinion.
**** Are you really having a crisis?
***** Make sure you're well-nourished.
Malnutrition can worsen mood.

Eat fruit, vegetable, and meat, if they don't make you sick.
Avoid too much processed food.
Avoid sugar.
Avoid flour.
Avoid burnt food.
Avoid sauces and condiments bought from supermarket.
Always read ingredients and nutrition facts.
If you want to snack, eat fruit, vegetable, or meat.
Eat whenever you want to eat, as long as the food is healthy.

You know you eat something with too much sugar if, an hour after eating it, your mouth tastes sour and smells bad.
That's the smell of sugar-eating bacteria party.

Appreciate hunger.
Learn to love being slightly hungry.
Eat attentively.
Taste every inch of the food.
Remember the flavor of the first bite.
Observe that the second bite tastes less.
Observe that the next bites tastes even less.
If you can't taste it, it means you have enough.

The first bite is joy.
Then it's okay.
Then it's unpleasant.
Then you'd rather eat something else.

If you want to always feel the joy of the first bite:
eat the first bite, rinse/gargle your mouth with water, rest your mouth until it tastes neutral, and then eat the next bite, and repeat.

Attentiveness can also help you quit smoking.
Smoke attentively.
Taste everything.
Taste the bitterness.
Think: do you really enjoy it?
People continue to smoke because they have learned to ignore the bad taste.
Normal people doesn't spontaneously seek to smoke because smoking tastes bad.
It's bitter.
It irritates the throat.
Why the hell would anyone like to choke and cough?
***** Exercise.
Exercise affects mood.
Exercise affects the brain.

You don't care about weight.
You want to gain muscle.
You want strength and flexibility.

Think like a kid who can't stop moving.
Simply will yourself to move.
Think that you love to move.
You can't stop moving.
You just want to move.
Squat.
***** If you're depressed, consult a health professional.
If you have depression, especially if you have depression running in your family, consult a health professional.

Matter affects mind.
Medication changes mood.
**** What is the meaning of life? Wrong question.
What do you want to do?

How do you justify your life?
How do others justify your life?
How do you justify others' lives?

Work simply means useful act.
It isn't about employment in a company.

Work justifies its author.
A deed justifies its doer.
(To justify is to give a reason for existence.)

Work-life balance is self-defeating.
Work justifies life.
Life is work.
If your work is not your life, you should find another work.
If you don't know what you want to do in your whole life, you're letting others waste your life.

After one copes with nihilism, there are only two outcomes: actualization (optimistic nihilism) or suicide (pessimistic nihilism).
**** Feeling is required.
Solving the crisis requires feeling.
Thinking without feeling worsens the crisis.

Why work?
Because not working feels weird.
Try not working for one year.
I did.
At first, it felt liberating.
After a month, it felt boring.
My mistake was that I quit my job emotionally without knowing what to do next.
The only right reason to quit your job is that you have something you absolutely surely want to accomplish in the rest of your life.
Fleeing from your boss is not an accomplishment.

*** eat
- How long to lose fat?

  - Weight changes very slowly, about 0.5 kg per week, too slow for us to realize.
    Time flies by, and suddenly it's been 2 months since you begin eating junk food,
    and now your pants don't fit.
    You gain 0.5 kg per week over one year,
    but you expect to lose those 26 kg in a week,
    which is not realistic.
  - 1 gram fat is 9 kcal.
    1 kg fat is 9000 kcal.
    If daily deficit is 1000 kcal (this may be too big; it will make you feel shit),
    you need 9 days to lose 1 kg.
    Losing 10 kg of fat won't take sooner than 90 days (3 months).
  - Focus on strength and health, not weight.

- What is the best staple food? Do we need staple food at all?

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food][WP: Staple food]]
  - Banana is the most practical staple food?
    Portable.
    Affordable.
    Perennial.
    Edible raw.
    No cooking required.
    Low poisoning risk.
    Ready in 5 seconds.
    Faster than fast food.
    [[https://muzunguinkampala.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/food-food-food-learn-to-eat-the-ugandan-way/][People in Uganda eat bananas]].
    Too much potassium?
    Hyperkalemia?
  - Banana spoils more easily than potato.
  - Potato needs washing and 20 minutes of simmering.
  - Wikipedia has a
    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food#Nutritional_content][table comparing the nutritional contents of common staple foods]].
  - Bananas?
    Don't need cooking.
    Have less poisoning risk than potato;
    Have no solanine.
    More hygienic (hanging in treetops, not buried in soil).
    Have shorter shelf life than potato.
  - Per kilogram, banana is slightly more expensive than potato: $2.30 vs $2.10.
    By bananas I mean the Cavendish banana.
  - I'll just eat bananas instead of potatos for carbohydrate.
  - Banana is a fruit; potato is a tuber.
  - Pan-frying egg takes 10 minutes.
  - Can boil eggs and potatos together.
  - Carrots grow in soil.
  - Broccoli?
    Beans?
    Cauliflower?
  - Fruits are faster than fast food.
    No need to cook.
    No need to wait.
    Just peel and eat.
  - Cooking

    - Frying is faster than boiling.
      Boiling is faster than steaming.
      Therefore frying uses less gas.
    - LPG flame temperature is constant (the blue flame temperature is about 2000 K).
      Flame size affects the heat transfer rate.
      Make sure that the utensil cover the ring.
      Undersized utensils waste the flame heat.

    - Banana is perhaps the easiest food for me.
    - Foods easy to cook:

      - Eggs

    - Would you eat pesticides, antibiotics, or hormones?
      Which is the least dangerous?
    - Sunkist orange is hard to open.
    - Apples? Too hard on the teeth.
    - Avocados? Expensive. Take too long to ripen.

  - You can eat aloe vera?
  - Corn can be eaten raw?

- What is trans fat? Why is trans fat bad?

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat][WP:Trans fat]]

    - "trans-unsaturated fatty acid"

- How is trans fat generated?

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat][WP:Trans fat]]

    - "Fats contain long hydrocarbon chains, which can either be unsaturated, i.e., have double bonds, or saturated, i.e., have no double bonds. In nature, unsaturated fatty acids generally have cis as opposed to trans configurations.[5] In food production, liquid cis-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties, e.g. they melt at a desirable temperature (30--40 °C). Partial hydrogenation of the unsaturated fat converts some of the cis double bonds into trans double bonds by an isomerization reaction with the catalyst used for the hydrogenation, which yields a trans fat.[2][3]"

*** egg
**** Materials
- Eggs (chicken eggs assumed)
**** Boiling eggs
For efficiency,
you can boil eggs and potatoes together.
Put a lid on the pot.

1. Wash the eggs and potatoes.
2. Submerge them under the water in the pot.
3. Put the pot on the stove.
4. Turn on the biggest fire.
5. Wait until the water reaches rolling boil.
6. Take the eggs out of the pot.
7. Turn the fire to low, just enough to replace the heat lost by the water.
8. Let the potatoes simmer for 25 minutes.

Boiled eggs don't dirty your hand as much as raw eggs
because boiled eggs insides are solid when you crack them.

You can boil eggs, potatoes, broccoli, and other things together.
The key is to take them out at different times.
**** Pan-frying sunny-side-up eggs
***** Tools
- Non-stick pan
- Spatula
- Stove
***** Procedure
Wash the eggs you are going to cook.

Break the eggs onto the pan.
Tap an egg to a hard flat surface
and let the contents drop into the pan.
You can cook as many eggs as your pan can fit at once.

Turn on the stove.
Use the smallest flame.
Close the pan with a lid.

Wait until the egg white becomes opaque.

Wait a while more until it emits an aroma.

Wait a while more until the egg does not stick to the pan.
Use a spatula to test the stickiness.

Flip the egg with a spatula.
You may need to lift and tilt the pan.

Wait until you get the desired doneness.

Turn off the stove.

Eat the egg.

Let the pan cool down for a few hours.

Wash the pan.
**** Why eggs?
Pan-frying eggs takes less than 10 minutes.

Egg is a cheap protein source.
One kilogram of chicken egg contains about
130 grams of protein and costs about $2,
thus about 1.53 cents per gram of protein
(in Indonesia in May 2017).
**** What to do with the waste?
Eggshell is rich in calcium carbonate.

I don't know what to do with the eggshell waste.
*** fight
- I don't know fighting. I'm not experienced in fighting.
- Real fight

  - The opponent is non-compliant.
  - No rules, no referee, no score.

- How to attack without being countered?
  How to attack without leaving weaknesses?

  - It's impossible if both combatants are equal.

    - When A attacks B in melee combat,
      both of them bring themselves into each other's range.

- How to respond to attack?
- What if the opponent is stronger, bigger, and faster?

  - Must be prepared.
    If one is not prepared to receive the attack,
    the attack will hit.

- The best response?

  - evade and counter
  - parry/deflect and counter
  - evade
  - parry
  - accept

- Parts of body used to attack:

  - skull, fist, nail, claw, hand, elbow, knee, feet, butt.
  - If we color the region around a human according to the maximum damage he can cause,
    there will be blind spots.

- If you are close to the opponent,
  he cannot use his muscles to accelerate the bat he is holding,
  but he may bite or headbutt.
- If you are too far /or/ too close to the opponent,
  he cannot harm you.
- Attacking a prepared opponent without being countered requires a decoy.
  But what if the opponent is also prepared for the decoy...
- Fleeing is an option.

Akhirnya berlabuh di Gojek.

- Gojek
  - Kadang pengemudi tidak bisa membaca.
    Tiap minggu ada saja pengemudi yang tidak baca catatan, lalu nyasar.
    Sangat buang waktu.
  - Kadang dapat motor Yamaha Aerox.
    - Motor ini tidak aman; pusat massa tinggi, mengurangi kestabilan.
    - Motor ini tidak nyaman; joknya keras, suspensinya keras, menyiksa pantat.
    - Contoh motor yang enak: Honda Scoopy.
      Tampilannya emang culun, tapi jok lebar dan empuk, dan suspensi juga lembut.
      Enak buat pantat.
    - (Saya tidak punya motor.
      Saya bukan fans Yamaha ataupun Honda.
      Saya cuma benci sakit pantat.)
  - Kadang ban kempes.
  - Pernah, jam 17:00, 30 menit gak ada yang ambil.
- Gocar
  - Kadang pengemudi mengantuk, merem melek.
    Mobil ngegas ngerem.
  - Posisi suka ngaco.
    Minta jemput di S Parman, supir di Mal Pondok Indah lah (12 km), di Pejompongan lah (6 km), di Tomang lah (4 km), di sisi jalan yang salah lah (4 km).
  - Kadang di-cancel 5 kali baru dapat.
  - Kadang mobil bau rokok.
- Grabcar
  - <2018-10-25> Saya ditinggal kabur supir grabcar, padahal saya tinggal 5 langkah dari mobil, dan dia belum ada 5 menit menunggu.
- Aplikasi Gojek vs Grab:
  - Grab lebih reliable.
  - Gojek lebih hemat baterai.
- Perasaan saya.
  - Teknologi keduanya shitty, tapi teknologi Grab less shitty daripada teknologi Gojek;
    Grabcar lebih bisa mencari supir yang dekat (500 m, 1 km); Gocar seringkali dapat supir (2 km, bahkan pernah 6 km).
  - Supir Gocar memperlakukan penumpang lebih baik daripada supir Grabcar memperlakukan penumpang.
    Mungkin karena Gojek lebih kejam ke supir.
* Learning languages
** Cantonese
http://wikitravel.org/en/Cantonese_phrasebook

The biggest problem of Cantonese:
it doesn't have /standard/ romanization like Hanyu Pinyin, does it?
Cantonese has three: Jyutping Romanization, Yale Romanization, and Cantonese Pinyin.
It unnecessarily fragments learning resources.

6 tones.

- 1: high
- 2: low-to-high
- 3: flat mid

Which is the romanization, Yale or Jyutping?

  - It is impractical to visit every corner of the world and see everything with our own eyes.
  - It is impractical to verify every sentence a person has ever uttered.

- Can we tell apart the liars from the honest people?

  - If you're wrong, don't apologize.
    Apologizing requires you to restate the charge and what gets repeated gets remembered.

As long as media optimizes themselves for maximum traffic (for advertising), people like Trump are going to win.
Sensationalism gets traffic.

Think of the headline that you want, and repeat it.
Headlines have to be short.
Keep your message simple.

** Abstract
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: abstract
   :END:

Your friends are those who sacrifice for you.
The greater the sacrifice,
the greater the friendship.
How do we measure a sacrifice?

** Measurement in theory
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: measurement-in-theory
   :END:

We define $F(A,B)$ (the /friendship measure from A to B/)
as how much sacrifice that A is willing to make for B.

(Is the direction correct? Is that backwards?)

Thus measuring friendship boils down to valuating sacrifices.

$F(A,B)$ can be approximated by an equivalent amount of money.

** Measurement in practice
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: measurement-in-practice
   :END:

Foot-in-the-door:
let A ask B to make bigger and bigger sacrifices until B refuses.
Then we have found $F(A,B)$.

Door-in-the-face:
let A ask B to make a sacrifice so big that B refuses,
and then let A ask B to make smaller and smaller sacrifices until B accepts.
Then we have found $F(A,B)$.

Those results may differ, but $F(A,B)$ should lie somewhere between those two points.
We can also average them, take the maximum, take the minimum,
use interval arithmetics,
or describe the result using a statistical distribution, for example.

** Properties

* Learning to play mahjong
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: learning-to-play-mahjong
  :END:

The variant discussed here is classic Chinese mahjong.

** Basic facts
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: basic-facts
   :END:

There are 136 mahjong tiles,
of which 52 are dealed to the players.
The remaining 84 forms the wall.
Thus, in a play, you only get at most 21 chances to change your hand,
that is 84 divided by 4 (the number of players).

If each player takes 15 seconds, then a hand
will take at most 4 x 15 x 21 = 1,260 seconds (21 minutes).

There are 136 tiles (not including 4 flower tiles and 4 season tiles):

There are 3 suits (bams, dots, and chars). Each suit has 9 classes. Each number has 4 instances. Thus each suit has 36 tiles. Thus there are 108 suit tiles.

There are 7 honors (4 winds and 3 dragons). Each honor has 4 instances. Thus there are 28 honor tiles.

There are 27 suit classes and 7 honor classes, giving a total of 34 classes.

Each tile class has 4 instances.

Each tile is equally probable to be drawn.

The probability of picking a tile class is 4/136. The odds of picking a tile class is 4:132.

** Number of chows, pungs, and kongs
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: number-of-chows-pungs-and-kongs
   :END:

The probability of drawing a pung:
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 * 2/134 = 1/3,015 (odd of 1 : 3,014, approx 1 : 3,000)

Each suit has 7 unique chows: 123, 234, 345, 456, 567, 678, 789.
There are 3 suits, so there are 21 unique chows.
Each tile has 4 instances.
Each chow has 4^3 instances.
The probability of drawing a chow: 21 * 4^3 / (136 * 135 * 134) = 28 / 51,255
(odd of 1 : 51,227, approx 1 : 51,000).

Pung is more likely than chow. Is this a calculation mistake?

The probability of drawing a kong (four identical tiles):
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 * 2/134 * 1/133 = 1/400,995 (odd of 1 : 400,994, approx 1 : 401,000)

The probability of drawing a pair:
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 = 1/45 (odd of 1 : 44)

The probability of drawing two tiles having the same class:
4/136 * 3/135 = 1/1,530 (odd of 1 : 1,529)

The probability of drawing two tiles having the same suit (3 suits):
3 * 36/136 * 35/135 = 7/34 (odd of 7 : 27, approx 1 : 4)

The probability of drawing a chow:
The probability of drawing n, n+1, n+2 unordered of the same suit, for n in 1 to 7:

3! * 3 * 7 * 4/136 * 4/135 * 4/134 = 56/17,085 (odd of 56 : 17,029, about 1 : 304)

The probability of drawing a pair, given that one tile has been drawn by another player:

Let each player draw exactly one tile. The probability of four players drawing the same tile:
34 * 4/136 * 3/135 * 2/134 * 1/133 = the probability of drawing a kong

  - To polarize someone is to make him more confident (about a belief).
  - Confirmation bias: People hear what they want to hear.

    - People filter incoming information.
    - People bend incoming information to conform with their preexisting beliefs.
    - Agreements polarize people, but disagreements don't depolarize people.
    - Information agreeing with preexisting belief polarize the believer.
    - Information disagreeing with preexisting belief is filtered out and doesn't depolarize the believer.

  - Key insight: We can change people's behavior without changing their beliefs.

- 2018-08-29 What I learned today.

  - To temporarily defuse your enemy's hatred of you, find another enemy that is common to both of you.

    - These happens in quick succession:
      Coworker A offended me.
      Then coworker B came and offended A in front of me.
      Then I offend coworker B in front of A.
      Then I can feel some agreement with coworker A.

  - The perception of having a common enemy unites people, even if the enemy is fake.

    - This has a concrete recommendations for countering the firehose of falsehood.

  - Trump and Putin use "firehose of falsehood" to assert power, in the same way school bullies do.
  - The only way to take power from them is to dismiss them.
    Media should stop giving them a platform.
    We should refuse to hear them.
    We should not fact-check, because by fact-checking we affirm that they have power.
    We should simply dismiss everything they say.
    Their competitors should counter-flood the media with their own firehoses.
  - I'm sure Trump and Putin are not the only people using that technique.
    I suspect that PKS may be using that technique in mosques in West Java.

* Spreading information in an organization

  :END:

- Two choices of where we can put the burden: the seeker and the source.

  - Polling: The person who needs an information seeks the person who might have it.
    This is hard because the person who needs an information might not realize that he needs the information. "Why wasn't I informed?"
  - Reacting: The person who has an information seeks the person who might need it.
    This is hard because this requires empathy and knowing the whole organization.

    - We can't depend on people.

  - Third way: There are people who specialize in collecting information from the sources and spreading information to the seekers.

- Which of those two systems is best?

  - I think the "polling" choice is the only sane choice.
    The "reacting" choice assumes too much about human altruism.

- A computer can help, but the final burden will always be on the seeker?

  - Mixture?

Building an organization that builds organizations.

Building an organization operating system.

- An organization is a group, a company, a business, a non-profit, etc..
- The goal: Every organization should use the same software for operations: accounting, financing, ERP, human resource management, issue tracking, workflow.
- Every library should use the same library information system.
- The organization can focus on its core competency.
- The business operations software should be so good that every organization uses it.

- Everyone has different willingness for travel.

  - Some travel is necessary.

    - Travel to work. Travel to make economic transactions.
    - This is ideally as efficient and fast as possible.
    - This forms the inelastic baseline demand.

  - The rest of travel is discretionary.

    - Travel to leisure.
    - This is ideally as enjoyable as possible.
    - This forms the elastic demand.

      - Counterintuitive

        - If road demand already exceeds supply, then widening roads increases traffic and causes more congestion.
