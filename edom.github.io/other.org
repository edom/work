  - Discrete Newtonian kinematical model

    - A /system at time \( t \)/ is a set of particles ( { 1, \ldots, n } ).

      - Time is a real number: \( t \in \Real \).
      - The number of particle is constant \( n \in \Nat \).
      - For each particle \( k \):

        - It has /position/ \( x_k \in \Real^3 \).
        - Simplifying assumptions

          - particle

            - It is a point.

              - It doesn't occupy any space.

            - Its mass is not modeled.

          - Time is global and absolute (the same everywhere).

  - Discrete Newtonian dynamical model (N-body problem) extends discrete Newtonian kinematical model.

    - A /system at time \( t \)/ is all that above, plus:

      - For each particle \( k \):

        - It has /mass/ \( m_k \in \Real \).
        - It has /resultant force/ \( F_k \) acting on it.
        - Simplifying assumptions about the particle

          - It is rigid.

            - It doesn't deform.
            - It doesn't break.

          - Its mass is constant.
          - It don't interact with other particles.

            - Particles don't merge or collide.

- Common company wiki fundamental problem:

  - Employees have no reason to read the wiki.
  - It doesn't help them do their jobs.

    - Why should they read it then?

- Library problems

  - In 2018, a lot of human knowledge is still in libraries and not available on the Internet.
    Digital typesetting was invented relatively recently.
    Papers should be scanned and OCR-ed.
    AI can help.
  - Why are there different libraries?
    There should be only one library in the world.
    All library should be the same.
    All library should have the same content.

    - The OP doesn't sound like his IQ is 89.

  - Higher IQ means faster learning, and that's all.
  - To each according to their ability.
    Society needs low IQ people.
    Some jobs fit low IQ people.
    These jobs are equally honorable as high IQ jobs are.
    Low IQ isn't an insult.

Human rights are legal fiction.
What is real is tolerance.
People let other people live.

How to measure member contribution?
This is hard, if even possible at all.
Thus it's a bad idea to distribute profit according to member contribution.
An alternative way to distribute is
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs][WP:From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]],
but it only works if there is abundance.

- Which assumption is better?

  - Assumption of scarcity: Human always wants more than what exists. There is never enough resources for everybody.
  - Assumption of abundance: There is a point where humans are satisfied. There are enough resources for everybody.

I think the assumption of abundance is saner.
But unfortunately it seems to lead to communism.

Software engineers share as much as possible to avoid repeating work.
They use operating systems, libraries.

Legislators could share more work.

Most software engineers use the same operating system.
Every country has its own constitution.
This is an insane amount of duplication.

There should be a "software library" for laws.
Laws should be reusable.
It should be able to legislate
"law X of country Y also holds in country Z, provided that every occurrence of X is replaced by Z".

In year 1000 AD who would have thought that 1000 years later we would have AI deepfakes,
human sex change (sex reassignment surgery, hormone therapy),
and what else reality-bending technologies we have.

In 2018 those technologies aren't perfect.
We can see deepfake artifacts.
We can tell apart transsexuals from their hips.
Maybe in the future those technologies will be perfected.
Maybe in the future people can be whoever they want to be.
"You are who you want to be" is getting more literal.

When that time comes, we will have more respect for philosophers.
If everything is easy to fake, then what is real, and how do we know it's real?
If everything is easy to fake, then what can be taken as proof in court?
What really exists?
If a man can easily become a woman, and a woman can easily become a man, then what does it mean to be a man/woman?
Do ID cards still make sense if you are immortal and you change your identity every 6 months?
Technology will force us to deal with ontology and epistemology.

Reality discontents humans.
We work hard to deceive our senses so that we can escape reality.
We try to make imagination real, and make reality irrelevant.
The Matrix is getting real.
