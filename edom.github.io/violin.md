This is my study notes, observations, and conclusions.
This is a bit disorganized.

I play the violin without chin rest and shoulder rest.

# The right pinky

The right pinky is for playing softly:
tilt the bow very slightly by pressing down the pinky (with the thumb as the fulcrum).
XXX: Is it by flexing the pinky or by supinating the hand?

Playing softly is harder than playing loudly.
Playing softly also uses more tension than playing loudly.

# Squeaking

Each bow speed has a range of pressure that will make a good sound.
Less bow speed needs less pressure.
The symptom of too much pressure for a bow speed is squeaking;
increase the bow speed, or decrease the bow pressure, or both.

Decrease the bow pressure by pressing the end of the bow with the right pinky,
with the thumb as the fulcrum.

# Playing open strings

Open strings, especially the A and E strings,
sound brighter than stopped strings,
so open strings will be perceived as louder
even though the bow speed and pressure stay the same.
In order to play scales with even dynamics,
we can avoid open strings,
or we can bow the open strings more softly
with reduced pressure and speed.

Also, we can play the D string nearer to the bridge to brighten it,
and the A string nearer to the fingerboard to darken it,
to make the change from the D to the A string smoother.

# Idea for group practice

Learning Kreutzer etudes together.

# Bouncing bows

The hairs act as a spring.

Vertical component of stick-slip.

Act as torque with the right thumb as the fulcrum.
