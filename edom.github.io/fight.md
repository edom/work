- I don't know fighting. I'm not experienced in fighting.
- Real fight
    - The opponent is non-compliant.
    - No rules, no referee, no score.
- How to attack without being countered?
How to attack without leaving weaknesses?
    - It's impossible if both combatants are equal.
        - When A attacks B in melee combat,
        both of them bring themselves into each other's range.
- How to respond to attack?
- What if the opponent is stronger, bigger, and faster?
    - Must be prepared.
    If one is not prepared to receive the attack,
    the attack will hit.
- The best response?
    - evade and counter
    - parry/deflect and counter
    - evade
    - parry
    - accept
- Parts of body used to attack:
    - skull, fist, nail, claw, hand, elbow, knee, feet, butt.
    - If we color the region around a human according to the maximum damage he can cause,
    there will be blind spots.
- If you are close to the opponent,
he cannot use his muscles to accelerate the bat he is holding,
but he may bite or headbutt.
- If you are too far *or* too close to the opponent,
he cannot harm you.
- Attacking a prepared opponent without being countered requires a decoy.
But what if the opponent is also prepared for the decoy...
- Fleeing is an option.
