Nori is edible seaweed species of the red algae genus _Pyropia_ ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nori)).
_Porphyra_ is known as nori in Japan
([Wikipedia again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laver_(seaweed))).
What?
Which is right?
[Phycology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phycology) is the study of algae.
It turns out [nori cultivation is hard](http://www.seaweed.ie/aquaculture/noricultivation.php).
Chickens are more complex organisms than algae,
but why is raising algae harder than raising chickens?
