- syntax, grammar, parsing, pretty-printing
    - Parsing is the act of modifying the *state* of the parser.
        - 2017, ["A Typed, Algebraic Approach to Parsing"](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nk480/parsing.pdf)
            - "[...] we extend the notion of Brzozowski derivative from regular expressions to the typed context-free expressions."
    - Unparsing is the linearization (serialization) of a tree.
    - Parsing is the treeization (delinearization, deserialization) of a line.
    - Parsing is String -> Maybe Tree.
    - Unparsing is Tree -> String.
    - Can we make parsing truly one-to-one? String -> Tree. CST = AST. Very rigid syntax. Forbid whitespace freedom.
    - Why lex (lexical analysis / tokenization)?
        - Cleaner grammar (no need to mention whitespaces in the grammar).
            - Example:
                - With lexing: `exp ::= exp "+" exp`
                - Without lexing: `exp ::= exp white "+" white exp`.
        - https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Compiler_Construction/Lexical_analysis
            - "Strictly speaking, tokenization may be handled by the parser. The reason why we tend to bother with tokenising in practice is that it makes the parser simpler,
            and decouples it from the character encoding used for the source code."
    - given grammar, generate both parser and unparser/pretty-printer

- Making compilers
    - From grammar description, the machine should generate both a parser and a pretty-printer.

            - Parser is syntax analyzer.
