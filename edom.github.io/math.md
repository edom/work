    - Every branch of mathematics has its own problems and theorems.
    - Every branch is a highly specialized subfield.
    - Two branches are likely mutually unintelligible.

    - Every area/part/subfield of mathematics center around some theorems and problems. What are the areas of mathematics, what are their problems, and what are their most important theorems? How did they start out? What was the problem that motivated them?

        - Tissot's indicatrices visualize a metric tensor by scattering
        many circles throughout a space
        so that we can see how the space's metric tensor distorts them.
        This method tells us how much our map is lying to us.
