- This page contains the old grouping that I haven't moved.
- This page is also a staging area, a queue, a scratchpad, for the things I shall process later.

    - Engineeringly, A type gives meaning to bit patterns.
    A type encodes meaning into bit patterns.
        - For example, consider the bit pattern 11111111.
            - It means -1 as an int8.
            - It means 127 as an uint8.
