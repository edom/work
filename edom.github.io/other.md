## what

- I am regrouping the contents in this website from by-topic to by-task.
- This page contains the old grouping that I haven't moved.
- This page is also a staging area, a queue, a scratchpad, for the things I shall process later.

    - Discrete Newtonian kinematical model
        - A *system at time \\( t \\)* is a set of particles <span>\( \{ 1, \ldots, n \} \)</span>.
            - Time is a real number: \\( t \in \Real \\).
            - The number of particle is constant \\( n \in \Nat \\).
            - For each particle \\( k \\):
                - It has *position* \\( x_k \in \Real^3 \\).

                    - particle
                        - It is a point.
                            - It doesn't occupy any space.
                        - Its mass is not modeled.
                    - Time is global and absolute (the same everywhere).
    - Discrete Newtonian dynamical model (N-body problem) extends discrete Newtonian kinematical model.
        - A *system at time \\( t \\)* is all that above, plus:
            - For each particle \\( k \\):
                - It has *mass* \\( m_k \in \Real \\).
                - It has *resultant force* \\( F_k \\) acting on it.
                - Simplifying assumptions about the particle

    - In 2018, a lot of human knowledge is still in libraries and not available on the Internet.
    Digital typesetting was invented relatively recently.
    Papers should be scanned and OCR-ed.
    AI can help.
    - Why are there different libraries?
    There should be only one library in the world.
    All library should be the same.
    All library should have the same content.

Although I'm happy to be proven wrong,
I believe that a minimum IQ of 120 is necessary but not sufficient for software engineering (cooperativeness is also required).
It seems IQ tests are inaccurate for high IQs above 130.

        - The OP doesn't sound like his IQ is 89.
    - Higher IQ means faster learning, and that's all.
    - To each according to their ability.
    Society needs low IQ people.
    Some jobs fit low IQ people.
    These jobs are equally honorable as high IQ jobs are.
    Low IQ isn't an insult.

Human rights are legal fiction.
What is real is tolerance.
People let other people live.
If I am still alive, it's because others let me live,
because others tolerate me,
not because I have any rights.

## Cooperatives?

What is the difference between cooperative and nonprofit?

Do cooperatives have limited liabilities like limited liability companies?

Cooperative is not a legal form?

How to measure member contribution?
This is hard, if even possible at all.
Thus it's a bad idea to distribute profit according to member contribution.
An alternative way to distribute is
[WP:From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs),
but it only works if there is abundance.

- Which assumption is better?
    - Assumption of scarcity: Human always wants more than what exists. There is never enough resources for everybody.
    - Assumption of abundance: There is a point where humans are satisfied. There are enough resources for everybody.

I think the assumption of abundance is saner.
But unfortunately it seems to lead to communism.

## Judaism, kareth, gays, and lesbians

- [WP:Kareth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareth)
    - It is interesting that a gay is punishable by kareth, but a lesbian is not punishable by kareth.
        - See item no. 4: "A male having sexual intercourse with another male".
        It doesn't say anything about "a female having sexual intercourse with another female".
    - It doesn't mean that Judaism allows lesbianism.
    There may be other rules somewhere else.

## It is insane that every country makes their own laws.

Software engineers share as much as possible to avoid repeating work.
They use operating systems, libraries.

Legislators could share more work.

Most software engineers use the same operating system.
Every country has its own constitution.
This is an insane amount of duplication.

There should be a "software library" for laws.
Laws should be reusable.
It should be able to legislate
"law X of country Y also holds in country Z, provided that every occurrence of X is replaced by Z".

## Converting between goods and services

SaaS converts goods (software) into services.
If you have goods, and you want to make it a service, then you host a software that controls access to that goods.

Robot converts services into goods.
If you have a service, and you want to make it a goods, then you make a robot that does that service.

## Justifying freedom

- Hypotheses:
    - People do/produce best (the highest quantity for the lowest price) when they pursue what they want to do/produce.
    - People approach their strengths and leave their weaknesses.
    - Different people have different goals.
    - Higher intrinsic motivation increases willingness to accept lower pay.

## Uncertainty in hiring

In hiring, if a candidate leaves good impressions (not exceptional, but decent nonetheless), but you aren't sure about him, should you just reject him?
Does "maybe" mean "no"?

- DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing): Checkpoint/Restart functionality for Linux processes
- android termux: can have bash, ssh, git, vim, emacs, and more on android
    - 2018-09-08: Too bad there is no clear way for android to charge while OTG (hosting) USB.
    Otherwise phones could kill netbooks.
    - 2018-09-08: a problem: can't close session with android keyboard (requires a physical keyboard plugged in via OTG USB)
- psychology?

## Rejecting reality?

In year 1000 AD who would have thought that 1000 years later we would have AI deepfakes,
human sex change (sex reassignment surgery, hormone therapy),
and what else reality-bending technologies we have.

In 2018 those technologies aren't perfect.
We can see deepfake artifacts.
We can tell apart transsexuals from their hips.
Maybe in the future those technologies will be perfected.
Maybe in the future people can be whoever they want to be.
"You are who you want to be" is getting more literal.

When that time comes, we will have more respect for philosophers.
If everything is easy to fake, then what is real, and how do we know it's real?
If everything is easy to fake, then what can be taken as proof in court?
What really exists?
If a man can easily become a woman, and a woman can easily become a man, then what does it mean to be a man/woman?
Do ID cards still make sense if you are immortal and you change your identity every 6 months?
Technology will force us to deal with ontology and epistemology.

Reality discontents humans.
We work hard to deceive our senses so that we can escape reality.
We try to make imagination real, and make reality irrelevant.
The Matrix is getting real.
