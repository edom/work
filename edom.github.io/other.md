    - [The First-Person and Third- Person Views](http://consc.net/notes/first-third.html)
- The job of a company (a company director?) is to find what to do and find who should do it.
    - Everyone has different tendencies, strengths, weaknesses, desires, preferences, habits, upbringings, backgrounds.
    - Some people are more suited for some jobs.
        - Some jobs require high IQ; otherwise the employee will take too long to learn.
        - Some jobs require low IQ; otherwise the employee will get bored too soon.
            - Yes, low IQ can be a strength.
    - The company has goals.
    - The director breaks down the goals into jobs.
    - The director matches employees and jobs.
    - Which comes first: the job or the employee?
        - Do you formulate a job description first, and then find people to do that?
        - Do you hire people first, and then formulate jobs suitable for them?
    - A good company accomplishes more than each employee can accomplish individually.

        - China isn't a rising power. It has always been big.
        - Big nations have big internal (intra-nation) struggles.
        - Most big nations (such as the old Chinese dynasties) fall due to internal struggles.

    - [Facts Don't Win Fights: Here’s How to Cut Through Confirmation Bias - Tali Sharot - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyioZODhKbE)
        - To polarize someone is to make him more confident (about a belief).
        - Confirmation bias: People hear what they want to hear.
            - People filter incoming information.
            - People bend incoming information to conform with their preexisting beliefs.
            - Agreements polarize people, but disagreements don't depolarize people.
            - Information agreeing with preexisting belief polarize the believer.
            - Information disagreeing with preexisting belief is filtered out and doesn't depolarize the believer.
        - A key insight? We don't need to change people's beliefs to change their behavior.
