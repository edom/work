- The job of a company (a company director?) is to find what to do and find who should do it.
    - Everyone has different tendencies, strengths, weaknesses, desires, preferences, habits, upbringings, backgrounds.
    - Some people are more suited for some jobs.
        - Some jobs require high IQ; otherwise the employee will take too long to learn.
        - Some jobs require low IQ; otherwise the employee will get bored too soon.
            - Yes, low IQ can be a strength.
    - The company has goals.
    - The director breaks down the goals into jobs.
    - The director matches employees and jobs.
    - Which comes first: the job or the employee?
        - Do you formulate a job description first, and then find people to do that?
        - Do you hire people first, and then formulate jobs suitable for them?
    - A good company accomplishes more than each employee can accomplish individually.

        - Confirmation bias: People hear what they want to hear.
            - People filter incoming information.
            - People bend incoming information to conform with their preexisting beliefs.
            - Agreements polarize people, but disagreements don't depolarize people.
            - Information agreeing with preexisting belief polarize the believer.

- Don't use GitFlow.
Use continuous integration and continuous deployment instead.
    - The `master` branch always builds, always runs, and is always releasable.
    - Everything goes to `master`. Sketches, hotfixes, everything.
    - Avoid non-master long-lived branches.
    - It is OK to introduce half-baked code into `master` as long as it doesn't introduce errors.
        - Use feature switch/toggle.
            - Just because code is in `master` doesn't mean it will be run on production.
        - Work-in-progress doesn't have to be full of errors.
    - Discipline yourself to make small commits and avoid big merges.
    - Discipline yourself to make backward-compatible changes, and deprecate things slowly.
        - Give your users time to migrate.
        - If your changes are always backward-compatible, you will never break someone else's code.
    - You can rebase/tidy up commits that you haven't pushed.
    - Merges and rebases produce the same working tree but have different uses.
        - The computer doesn't care whether you merge or rebase.
        - Merges and rebases exist for the humans.

    - [transcript](https://bigthink.com/videos/douglas-rushkoff-on-the-internet-and-the-future-of-business)
        - We should verify and distill these texts.
        These are some bold claims.
            - "As the peasants became wealthy the aristocracy got scared, who are these people?
            They're not going to be dependent on us any more.
            So they came up with two main financial innovations to prevent the rise of this peer to peer economy.
            The first one was the chartered monopoly, really the parent to the modern corporation.
            All the chartered monopoly was was a way to say all of you small businesses are now illegal.
            If you want to be in the shoe business you have to work for his majesty's royal shoe company.
            You want to be in the grain business you have to work for his majesty's royal grain company.
            So people who were small business people now became employees.
            Instead of selling the value they created, now they sold their time as servants, as wage laborers."
            - "The second invention they came up with was central currency.
            Not such a terrible thing in itself.
            It's great to have a long distance currency that lots of people can use and value, but the problem was they made all of the local currencies illegal.
            So the only way people could trade with each other, the candlestick maker could trade with the chicken farmer was by borrowing central currency from the treasury.
            So now you had to borrow money at interest just in order to transact.
            And that set in motion really a growth cascade.
            If you have a currency that has to be paid back with interest, in order to just make end meet you need an economy that's growing.
            You need more money next year than there was this year."
            - "So that worked well for colonial powers, as long as we could extend into Africa and South America and North America, find slaves, find new resources, we could grow.
            But what happens when you reach the end of the planet's growth as we did really at the end of World War II?"

        - Java has better namespacing than C.
        - Enable the same name to be used in different context, so that you can write `get_name employee` and `get_name company` instead of `employee_get_name employee` or `company_get_name company`.

                - F# uses `tf<'a>`.
                - Haskell uses `Tf a`.
            - Would you rather type `'a list` (F#) or deal with an inadequate record/module system (Haskell)?
            - Haskell doesn't have `instance Read (->)` and `instance Show (->)`.
                - Haskell expressions are not first-class citizen in the language.
                    - Unlike Lisp/Scheme.

    - Mathematically, A type is a set whose membership is syntactically decidable.
    - Engineeringly, A type gives meaning to bit patterns.
    A type encodes meaning into bit patterns.
        - For example, consider the bit pattern 11111111.
            - It means -1 as an int8.
            - It means 127 as an uint8.

- Work-life balance?
    - Life *is* work.
    - Your work defines you.
    You are only as good as your contribution to the world.
    Your work defines the meaning of your life.
    - Don't confuse working with employment.
        - Work is everything that creates value.
        - Employment is just a kind of work.
    - Don't confuse being busy and working.
        - Work should create value.
        - You can feel busy while not producing anything.
        - Work has goals. Being busy doesn't have goals.
    - People don't care about processes.
    They only care about results.
