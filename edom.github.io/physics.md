- In the 21st century
    - Every branch of physics is about constructing a mathematical model of nature.
        - Every branch is interested in different aspects of nature.
            - Example: Mechanics is interested in motion.
- Physics can't be separated from philosophy, mathematics, and engineering?
- Philosophy of physics
    - The epistemology (how-do-we-know) of physics is the scientific method.
        - [WP:Scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)
        - [WP:Hypothetico-deductive model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetico-deductive_model)
        - If theory and experiment disagree, experiment wins.
            - Unless the experiment is faulty.
        - Are there alternatives?
    - The ontology?
        - Something is defined by its properties?
        - Something is defined by its behaviors (relation to others)?
        - [WP:Intrinsic and extrinsic properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_and_extrinsic_properties_(philosophy))
    - [WP:Philosophy of physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_physics)
    - [WP:Philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science)
        - [WP:Demarcation problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem): What is science? What isn't?
- Newton's insight
    - Both the apple and the moon fall toward the Earth *in the same way* (due to the same cause: "gravity").
- Ontology
    - an attempt
        - undefined terms
            - touch
        - A *matter* is something we can touch.
            - The air is also a matter because we can feel it with our sense of touch.
            - Problem: subjective definition
                - What about people without sense of touch?
                    - [WP:Anaphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphia)
                    - [WP:Hypoesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoesthesia)
            - Is there a definition that doesn't depend on our senses?
                - Is such definition even possible?
                    - Should "matter" be undefined?
                        - Is physics about explaining our perceptions?
            - A matter is something that exists?
                - But how do we know that it exists if not from our senses?
                    - Is there a teapot orbiting the sun?
                        - [WP:Russell's teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot)
                            - How do we prove non-existence?
                                - Do we have to?
                                    - Yes?
                                        - Who claims, proves.
                                            - If you claim that someone raped you, you have to prove it.
                                            - Problem?
                                                - If you claim that someone has *never* raped you, you have to prove it.
                                                    - But how?
                                                        - Let there be three people X, Y, Z.
                                                        - Z (probably a judge in a court) doesn't know either X or Y.
                                                        - How does X prove, to Z, that Y has never raped X?
                                                            - There are things that are true but unprovable?
                                                                - Is God true but unprovable (if there is a coherent definition of "God")?
                                                    - This can be used as a joke?
                                                        - X: "Hey, do you know? Y has never raped me, but I can't prove it."
                                                        - Z: "So, what are you suggesting?"
                                                - How do we prove that Y has never transferred anything to X's bank account?
                                                    - We assume that the bank is honest and maintains correct records.
                                                        - Why should Z accept this assumption?
                                                            - Should Z still accept this assumption if X owned the bank?
                                                    - The bank record is finite.
                                                    - Then we only need to check exhaustively whether there is anything from Y in the records.
                                                - How do we prove that there isn't a teapot orbiting the sun?
                                                    - We can't visit every point in space.
                                                    - We can't exhaustive-check the entire Universe.
                                                    - We can't.
                                                    - But we can say that it's *implausible*.
                                                        - Why? How?
                                                        - What if there is really a teapot-shaped space rock orbiting the sun?
                                                - How do you prove that two people have never met before?
                                                - How to prove libel?
                                                    - Suppose:
                                                        - X did rape Y.
                                                        - Y claims that X raped Y, but can't prove it.
                                                    - Then can X countersue Y with libel?
                                            - If you claim that God exists, you have to prove it.
                                            - If you claim that God doesn't exist, you also have to prove it.
                                            - If you don't claim that God exists or not, then you don't have to prove anything.
                                            - If you *believe* something, then you don't have to prove anything to others,
                                            as long as you don't claim it before them.
                                                - Our belief is a claim we make before ourselves.
                                                If we can prove it, good for us.
                                                If we can't prove it, it's our problem.
                                                - But, spreading a belief is making a claim before others.
                                                It has to be proven.
    - concepts
        - mass, acceleration, force
            - Mass is resistance to force.

                    - Force accelerates mass.
            - Mass is the amount of matter.
