- Prescription
    - I use "he" as both male and gender-neutral singular third-person pronoun.
    - Ambiguity resolution rules
        - If the context makes sense for both genders, then "he" is gender-neutral.
- Languages without this problem
    - Indonesian has gender-neutral third-person pronoun "dia" and "beliau".
