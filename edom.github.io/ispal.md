- I propose this for the Israel-Palestine problem:
    - Country
        - Establish a new country (say "Ispal"), merging Israel and Palestine.
    - Government
        - Everyone in the Israeli government is in the Ispalian government.
        - Everyone in the Palestinian government is in the Ispalian government.
    - Land
        - The land of Ispal is the land of Israel plus the land of Palestine.
    - Citizen
        - Every Israeli is an Ispalian.
        - Every Palestinian is an Ispalian.
    - Law
        - Every Ispalian is equal before the law.
    - Why this might not be accepted
        - Idealism, fanaticism, narrow-mindedness, intolerance, ignorance of history, mixing religion and politics
