    - an index of my research work, and
    - my ramblings (to be moved to their own pages).

- Software and law
    - Similarity
        - Bad software and bad law both result in unnecessarily slow system.
        - Both are based on logic.
        - Both have an ontology.
        - The law of a country is a big (possibly inconsistent) logic program.
            - The law in writing vs the law in practice
                - I think it is too much for anyone to know all laws that are in effect in a country.
    - Difference
        - A judge cares about both the letter of the law and the spirit of the law.
        - A computer cares only about the letter of the software.
        There is no such thing as the spirit of the software.
            - A computer does what we write, not what we mean.
                - The programmer follows the computer's rules. Not the other way around.

- Linguistics
    - How do we use language?
        - We assume:
            - Every adjective is fuzzy.
            - Truth is a continuum.
