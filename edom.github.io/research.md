## Ramblings and undigested matters

- Software and law
    - Similarity
        - Bad software and bad law both result in unnecessarily slow system.
        - Both are based on logic.
        - Both have an ontology.
        - The law of a country is a big (possibly inconsistent) logic program.
            - The law in writing vs the law in practice
                - I think it is too much for anyone to know all laws that are in effect in a country.
    - Difference
        - A judge cares about both the letter of the law and the spirit of the law.
        - A computer cares only about the letter of the software.
        There is no such thing as the spirit of the software.
            - A computer does what we write, not what we mean.
                - The programmer follows the computer's rules. Not the other way around.

- Linguistics
    - How do we use language?
        - We assume:
            - Every adjective is fuzzy.
            - Truth is a continuum.
- Corruptors and their offsprings have so much money that they don't know what to do with it.

    - Ubuntu crashed without log.
        - Screen turned off suddenly.
        - Keyboard forze.
        - Power button didn't respond even after 4 seconds.
        - The problem turned out to be shitty graphics card connection.
            - Hardware problem, not Ubuntu problem.
            - Probably dust or oxidized connectors.
                - It would be nice if graphics card could be hotswapped though.
                    - But do we want to touch a running graphics card?
        - The fix: unplug and plug the card several times.
- Economics vs finance
    - Economics is about value?
    - Finance is about money?
- How do I find people who care about what I care?
- How do I find people with interests similar to mine?
- How to make money
    - Make hard things easy.
- Should we use holidays to form strategic alliances?
- To form quality relationship, socialize with one person at a time?
- There are only two way of getting rich:
    - create value (make others better)
    - extract value (steal from others, either legally or illegally)

- Marketing
