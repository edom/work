## Ramblings and undigested matters

- Linguistics
    - How do we use language?
        - We assume:
            - Every adjective is fuzzy.
            - Truth is a continuum.
- Corruptors and their offsprings have so much money that they don't know what to do with it.

    - Ubuntu crashed without log.
        - Screen turned off suddenly.
        - Keyboard forze.
        - Power button didn't respond even after 4 seconds.
        - The problem turned out to be shitty graphics card connection.
            - Hardware problem, not Ubuntu problem.
            - Probably dust or oxidized connectors.
                - It would be nice if graphics card could be hotswapped though.
                    - But do we want to touch a running graphics card?
        - The fix: unplug and plug the card several times.
- Economics vs finance
    - Economics is about value?
    - Finance is about money?
- How do I find people who care about what I care?
- How do I find people with interests similar to mine?
- How to make money
    - Make hard things easy.
- Should we use holidays to form strategic alliances?
- To form quality relationship, socialize with one person at a time?
- There are only two way of getting rich:
    - create value (make others better)
    - extract value (steal from others, either legally or illegally)
