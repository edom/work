- Mapmaking, cartography
    - Tissot's indicatrices visualize a metric tensor by scattering
    many circles throughout a space
    so that we can see how the space's metric tensor distorts them.
    This method tells us how much our map is lying to us.

    "[...] John, when people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together."

- Is Indonesia basic income feasible?
    - [APBN 2016](https://www.kemenkeu.go.id/apbn2016) income Rp 1,822.5 trillion (in one year).
    - 2016 population 258 million people. (source?)
    - Thus about Rp 7 million per man-year.
        - This isn't even enough to buy food for one man-year.
