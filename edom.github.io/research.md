            - You teach computers your thoughts.
            Then they mimic you.
            People can interact with "you" through computers.
            Then "you" would be digitally "immortal".
            But you'll still die.
            "You" is the machine's model of you.
            - It's like hiring someone to imitate you for life.
            - Is it legit?
