** Determining when your pants rise is too low
Your pants rise is too low if any of these are true:
- You feel your pants are cleaving your crotch.
- Your buttcrack shows when you bend over.
* Hairstyles
** longhair
- To be a long-haired man is to run a social experiment.

  - Should not exist, people who

    - live in the 21th century and
    - think that men shouldn't wear long hair.

** crisis
*** Disclaimer
This is my opinion.
*** Are you really having a crisis?
**** Make sure you're well-nourished.
Malnutrition can worsen mood.

Eat fruit, vegetable, and meat, if they don't make you sick.
Avoid too much processed food.
Avoid sugar.
Avoid flour.
Avoid burnt food.
Avoid sauces and condiments bought from supermarket.
Always read ingredients and nutrition facts.
If you want to snack, eat fruit, vegetable, or meat.
Eat whenever you want to eat, as long as the food is healthy.

You know you eat something with too much sugar if, an hour after eating it, your mouth tastes sour and smells bad.
That's the smell of sugar-eating bacteria party.

Appreciate hunger.
Learn to love being slightly hungry.
Eat attentively.
Taste every inch of the food.
Remember the flavor of the first bite.
Observe that the second bite tastes less.
Observe that the next bites tastes even less.
If you can't taste it, it means you have enough.

The first bite is joy.
Then it's okay.
Then it's unpleasant.
Then you'd rather eat something else.

If you want to always feel the joy of the first bite:
eat the first bite, rinse/gargle your mouth with water, rest your mouth until it tastes neutral, and then eat the next bite, and repeat.

Attentiveness can also help you quit smoking.
Smoke attentively.
Taste everything.
Taste the bitterness.
Think: do you really enjoy it?
People continue to smoke because they have learned to ignore the bad taste.
Normal people doesn't spontaneously seek to smoke because smoking tastes bad.
It's bitter.
It irritates the throat.
Why the hell would anyone like to choke and cough?
**** Exercise.
Exercise affects mood.
Exercise affects the brain.

You don't care about weight.
You want to gain muscle.
You want strength and flexibility.

Think like a kid who can't stop moving.
Simply will yourself to move.
Think that you love to move.
You can't stop moving.
You just want to move.
Squat.
**** If you're depressed, consult a health professional.
If you have depression, especially if you have depression running in your family, consult a health professional.

Matter affects mind.
Medication changes mood.
*** What is the meaning of life? Wrong question.
What do you want to do?

How do you justify your life?
How do others justify your life?
How do you justify others' lives?

Work simply means useful act.
It isn't about employment in a company.

Work justifies its author.
A deed justifies its doer.
(To justify is to give a reason for existence.)

Work-life balance is self-defeating.
Work justifies life.
Life is work.
If your work is not your life, you should find another work.
If you don't know what you want to do in your whole life, you're letting others waste your life.

After one copes with nihilism, there are only two outcomes: actualization (optimistic nihilism) or suicide (pessimistic nihilism).
*** Feeling is required.
Solving the crisis requires feeling.
Thinking without feeling worsens the crisis.

Why work?
Because not working feels weird.
Try not working for one year.
I did.
At first, it felt liberating.
After a month, it felt boring.
My mistake was that I quit my job emotionally without knowing what to do next.
The only right reason to quit your job is that you have something you absolutely surely want to accomplish in the rest of your life.
Fleeing from your boss is not an accomplishment.

** eat
- How long to lose fat?

  - Weight changes very slowly, about 0.5 kg per week, too slow for us to realize.
    Time flies by, and suddenly it's been 2 months since you begin eating junk food,
    and now your pants don't fit.
    You gain 0.5 kg per week over one year,
    but you expect to lose those 26 kg in a week,
    which is not realistic.
  - 1 gram fat is 9 kcal.
    1 kg fat is 9000 kcal.
    If daily deficit is 1000 kcal (this may be too big; it will make you feel shit),
    you need 9 days to lose 1 kg.
    Losing 10 kg of fat won't take sooner than 90 days (3 months).
  - Focus on strength and health, not weight.

    Affordable.
    Perennial.
    Edible raw.

    Too much potassium?
    Hyperkalemia?
  - Banana spoils more easily than potato.
  - Potato needs washing and 20 minutes of simmering.

    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food#Nutritional_content][table comparing the nutritional contents of common staple foods]].
  - Bananas?
    Don't need cooking.
    Have less poisoning risk than potato;
    Have no solanine.
    More hygienic (hanging in treetops, not buried in soil).
    Have shorter shelf life than potato.
  - Per kilogram, banana is slightly more expensive than potato: $2.30 vs $2.10.
    By bananas I mean the Cavendish banana.
  - I'll just eat bananas instead of potatos for carbohydrate.
  - Banana is a fruit; potato is a tuber.

  - Cooking

    - Frying is faster than boiling.
      Boiling is faster than steaming.
      Therefore frying uses less gas.
    - LPG flame temperature is constant (the blue flame temperature is about 2000Â K).
      Flame size affects the heat transfer rate.
      Make sure that the utensil cover the ring.
      Undersized utensils waste the flame heat.

- What is trans fat? Why is trans fat bad?

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat][WP:Trans fat]]

    - "trans-unsaturated fatty acid"

- How is trans fat generated?

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat][WP:Trans fat]]

    - "Fats contain long hydrocarbon chains, which can either be unsaturated, i.e., have double bonds, or saturated, i.e., have no double bonds. In nature, unsaturated fatty acids generally have cis as opposed to trans configurations.[5] In food production, liquid cis-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties, e.g.Â they melt at a desirable temperature (30--40 Â°C). Partial hydrogenation of the unsaturated fat converts some of the cis double bonds into trans double bonds by an isomerization reaction with the catalyst used for the hydrogenation, which yields a trans fat.[2][3]"

  - Fast food is food that is served quickly (because someone else has cooked it for you).
  - Junk food is unhealthy food.

    - Too much processing.
    - Unbalanced nutrition.
    - Damaging metabolic products.

- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr4MmmWQtZM][Why is it so Easy to be Thin in Japan?]]

** egg
*** Materials
- Eggs (chicken eggs assumed)
*** Boiling eggs
For efficiency,
you can boil eggs and potatoes together.
Put a lid on the pot.

1. Wash the eggs and potatoes.
2. Submerge them under the water in the pot.
3. Put the pot on the stove.
4. Turn on the biggest fire.
5. Wait until the water reaches rolling boil.
6. Take the eggs out of the pot.
7. Turn the fire to low, just enough to replace the heat lost by the water.
8. Let the potatoes simmer for 25 minutes.

Boiled eggs don't dirty your hand as much as raw eggs
because boiled eggs insides are solid when you crack them.

You can boil eggs, potatoes, broccoli, and other things together.
The key is to take them out at different times.
*** Pan-frying sunny-side-up eggs
**** Tools
- Non-stick pan
- Spatula
- Stove
**** Procedure
Wash the eggs you are going to cook.

Break the eggs onto the pan.
Tap an egg to a hard flat surface
and let the contents drop into the pan.
You can cook as many eggs as your pan can fit at once.

Turn on the stove.
Use the smallest flame.
Close the pan with a lid.

Wait until the egg white becomes opaque.

Wait a while more until it emits an aroma.

Wait a while more until the egg does not stick to the pan.
Use a spatula to test the stickiness.

Flip the egg with a spatula.
You may need to lift and tilt the pan.

Wait until you get the desired doneness.

Turn off the stove.

Eat the egg.

Let the pan cool down for a few hours.

Wash the pan.
*** Why eggs?
Pan-frying eggs takes less than 10 minutes.

Egg is a cheap protein source.
One kilogram of chicken egg contains about
130 grams of protein and costs about $2,
thus about 1.53 cents per gram of protein
(in Indonesia in May 2017).
*** What to do with the waste?
Eggshell is rich in calcium carbonate.

I don't know what to do with the eggshell waste.
** fight
- I don't know fighting. I'm not experienced in fighting.
- Real fight

  - The opponent is non-compliant.
  - No rules, no referee, no score.

- How to attack without being countered?
  How to attack without leaving weaknesses?

  - It's impossible if both combatants are equal.

    - When A attacks B in melee combat,
      both of them bring themselves into each other's range.

- How to respond to attack?
- What if the opponent is stronger, bigger, and faster?

  - Must be prepared.
    If one is not prepared to receive the attack,
    the attack will hit.

- The best response?

  - evade and counter
  - parry/deflect and counter
  - evade
  - parry
  - accept

- Parts of body used to attack:

  - skull, fist, nail, claw, hand, elbow, knee, feet, butt.
  - If we color the region around a human according to the maximum damage he can cause,
    there will be blind spots.

- If you are close to the opponent,
  he cannot use his muscles to accelerate the bat he is holding,
  but he may bite or headbutt.
- If you are too far /or/ too close to the opponent,
  he cannot harm you.
- Attacking a prepared opponent without being countered requires a decoy.
  But what if the opponent is also prepared for the decoy...
- Fleeing is an option.

** mouth
- Dental plaque will grow even if we don't eat anything.

  - The microbes eat the dead cells we shed inside the mouth.

    - Thus we need to visit the dentist every about 6 months for scaling.

** muscle
- [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg][What makes muscles grow? - Jeffrey Siegel]]

  - nutrition
  - hypertrophy is due to microfracture healing

    - microfracture is due to contraction that is

      - challenging (harder than the muscle's comfort zone)
      - eccentric (shortening the muscle: flexing the muscle while it is extended/stretched out)

- How to retrain muscles killed by sitting?

  - What exercises isolate the glutes?

    - hip thrust against gravity
    - "Its most powerful action is to cause the body to regain the erect position after stooping, by drawing the pelvis backward, [...]." ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluteus_maximus_muscle][WP: Gluteus maximus muscle]])
    - "Semitendinosus and semimembranosus extend the hip when the trunk is fixed; they also flex the knee and medially (inwardly) rotate the lower leg when the knee is bent." [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring_muscles][WP: Hamstring muscles]]

  - Squatting undoes sitting damage?
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_fasciae_latae_muscle][WP:Tensor fasciae latae muscle]]

    - "Because it is used for so many movements and is in a shortened position when seated, the TFL becomes tight easily.
      TFL stretches lengthen this important muscle." (doubtful source?)

** walk
- Proper walking increases mood.
- Hypothesis:
  proper walking minimizes the sum of
  the magnitudes of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_%28physics%29][jerk]]s of all joints.
- If your walk is noisy, you're jerking your joints.
- Things to do:

  - land with the ball of the feet
  - fix the anterior pelvic tilt
  - focus on pushing the back foot, not on pulling the front foot

- orthotropics, mewing, https://www.reddit.com/r/orthotropics/
* Buying shoes.
My needs:
- Comfortable for walking and running long distance.
- Zero maintenance, and won't break in 100 years, especially the insole.
  No cleaning, polishing, semir, whatever.
  - ? https://samuraiinsoles.com/
- What insole material?
  - plastic
  - metal
  - stone
  - aerogel
  - memory foam
  - graphene (strong but elastic)

      - "leather untreated can be vulnerable to water damage"
        - surely the leather is treated first?
      - "Because the material is less durable than its leather and textile counterparts, however, synthetic shoes tend to degrade faster and need replacing more often."
    - https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-durable-shoe-brands-for-men
      - "Look for a shoe that is (1) all leather.
        I found the man-made soles and outsoles to be the first thing to deteriorate.
        And (2) handmade."

  - https://www.quora.com/What-material-is-the-best-for-the-sole-of-shoes
My options:
- Self-reinforce the soles with double-tapes or FlexTape/FlexSeal/FlexShot/window glue.
  This risks uneven shoe heights and compensating gait which may be pathological in the long-term.
- Repair/reinforce the current shoes at tukang sol sepatu.
- Buy Dr Martens guaranteed shoes at GI.
  But what if that store goes bust?
  What are the terms of the guarantee?
  How long is the wait time?
  Will the replacement be the same product?
- Buy army surplus shoes as Abdullah did.
- Cobble my own shoes.
- Just buy new shoes every year.
- Buy many shoes at once, and rotate them.
  - Does it work? Why?

  - https://www.quora.com/Does-rotating-leather-shoes-make-them-last-longer
  - If a shoe lasts 3 years, and I have 60 more years to wear shoes, then I should buy 20 pairs of shoes right now and rotate them?
    - Wouldn't those shoes rot in my home?
- It's safer to buy 20 pairs of average shoes than 1 pair of expensive shoes.
  If shit happens, you still get 19 pairs, instead of nothing at all.
- What else?
