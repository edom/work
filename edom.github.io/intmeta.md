        - He is trying to find out how the brain works.
        - The idea: If a learning algorithm works on machines, then it might have something to do with how brains work.
        - More interested in physical explanation of how the brain works.
        Physics first, math second, although his math is OK.
    - Yann LeCun
    - JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber
    - Pedro Domingos
    - Demis Hassabis
        - What is his focus?
    - Who else? There are lots of people.

## How are others' works progressing?

- How is [Pedro Domingos](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/)'s progress of finding the master algorithm unifying the five tribes?
    - Markov logic network unifies probabilists and logicians.
        - How about the other three tribes?
    - Hume's question: How do we justify generalization? Why does generalization work?
        - Does Wolpert answer that in "no free lunch theorem"?
            - [Wikipedia: No free lunch theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem)
        - I think induction works because our Universe
        happens to have a structure that is amenable to induction.
            - If induction doesn't work, and evolution is true,
            then we would have gone extinct long ago, wouldn't we?
                - What structure is that?
