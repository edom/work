- Two choices of where we can put the burden: the seeker and the source.
    - Polling: The person who needs an information seeks the person who might have it.
    This is hard because the person who needs an information might not realize that he needs the information. "Why wasn't I informed?"
    - Reacting: The person who has an information seeks the person who might need it.
    This is hard because this requires empathy and knowing the whole organization.
        - We can't depend on people.
    - Third way: There are people who specialize in collecting information from the sources and spreading information to the seekers.
- Which of those two systems is best?
    - I think the "polling" choice is the only sane choice.
    The "reacting" choice assumes too much about human altruism.
- A computer can help, but the final burden will always be on the seeker?
    - Mixture?

    - The most effective way to spread information in an organization is a combination of email and informal meetings.
