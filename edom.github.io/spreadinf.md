- Two choices of where we can put the burden: the seeker and the source.
    - Polling: The person who needs an information seeks the person who might have it.
    This is hard because the person who needs an information might not realize that he needs the information. "Why wasn't I informed?"
    - Reacting: The person who has an information seeks the person who might need it.
    This is hard because this requires empathy and knowing the whole organization.
- Which of those two systems is best?
- A computer can help, but the final burden will always be on the seeker?
    - Mixture?
