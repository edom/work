- The goal is to make *the* programming language.
- What are the criteria for a language to be adopted?
    - In order for a language to be adopted, people must perceive its risk as low.
        - The language must work with existing codebases.
            - The language designer must think from the language user's point of view.
                - Let's say I have 100,000 lines of Java that I've been writing and testing for the past 5 years.
                Are you expecting me throw away all of them?
            - Thus the language must work with C, C++, C#, Java, Go, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and everything else.
            This should be possible because the essence of all programming languages is the same: every programming language is a formal system.
            It should be possible to translate a program P1 in language L1 to program P2 in language L2 with the same semantics.
            - Improve/enhance, not supersede.
        - Mixing the old and new languages should be easy.
        - 2013, article, "Empirical analysis of programming language adoption", [pdf](http://sns.cs.princeton.edu/docs/asr-oopsla13.pdf)
    - The language must be suitable for systems programming.
        - System programming is hardware-aware programming.
        Application programming assumes abstract machine, infinite memory, and all convenience provided by the operating system.
            - Why do we make this distinction?
- A goal of programming language research is to make a better programming language (if not the best).
    - Do more with less.
    - *The* ultimate best programming language?
- Basic assumptions
    - Computer (machine) is embodied formal system.
        - Assume no hardware fault.
    - Software is executable mathematics.
- The [Sixten](https://github.com/ollef/sixten) language might be a good starting point.
- Every functional programming language is lambda calculus plus plus.
    - Every functional programming language L can be modeled by a category C(L) whose objects are the types of L and arrows are the function expressions of L.
    - I thought lambda calculus could be summarized in one page, but Henk Barendregt wrote hundreds of pages about it. Is there more to lambda calculus than it seems?

- syntax, grammar, parsing, pretty-printing
    - Parsing is the act of modifying the *state* of the parser.
        - 2017, ["A Typed, Algebraic Approach to Parsing"](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nk480/parsing.pdf)
            - "[...] we extend the notion of Brzozowski derivative from regular expressions to the typed context-free expressions."
    - Unparsing is the linearization (serialization) of a tree.
    - Parsing is the treeization (delinearization, deserialization) of a line.
    - Parsing is String -> Maybe Tree.
    - Unparsing is Tree -> String.
    - Can we make parsing truly one-to-one? String -> Tree. CST = AST. Very rigid syntax. Forbid whitespace freedom.
    - Why lex (lexical analysis / tokenization)?
        - Cleaner grammar (no need to mention whitespaces in the grammar).
            - Example:
                - With lexing: `exp ::= exp "+" exp`
                - Without lexing: `exp ::= exp white "+" white exp`.
        - https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Compiler_Construction/Lexical_analysis
            - "Strictly speaking, tokenization may be handled by the parser. The reason why we tend to bother with tokenising in practice is that it makes the parser simpler,
            and decouples it from the character encoding used for the source code."

            - JVM does too much.
                - JVM bytecode verification
                    - It's the compiler's job, not the VM's.
                    - Does it even add any security?

        - What I'm not sure about Java
            - Why type erasure?
                - C# 2.0 introduced generics, without type erasure, while maintaining backward compatibility.
                    - Duplicating everything in System.Collections to System.Collections.Generic is ugly, but it's less ugly than type erasure.

    - What I think every procedural programming language (Java, C, C++, Go, Python, Ruby) gets wrong, except JavaScript
        - Functions should be first-class. Methods should not exist. Fields are enough.
        - It should be possible to assign to methods.
        - `a.b()` should not mean "call method b of object a"
        - `a.b()` should mean "get the function a.b, then call it".
        - `a.b()` should mean `(a.b)()`.
            - `m = a.b; m();` should mean the same as `a.b()`.
        - JavaScript does this right.
        - What JavaScript does wrong, TypeScript does right.
    - What I think C and C++ got right but get wrong
        - In the 1970s these were tolerable (memory was limited; tools didn't exist). In 2018 these aren't tolerable.
            - Writing header files manually (should be generated from C files instead)
            - Preprocessor that works on text, not on C/C++ AST
    - What I think Haskell gets wrong
        - Template Haskell
            - Instead, we should have a metaprogramming library, and generate hs files.
        - Build is too slow.
            - Where should we fix this? GHC? Cabal?
    - What I think every imperative programming language gets wrong
        - Statements vs expressions
            - Statement should not exist. Only expressions should.
                - Xtend and Haxe do this right.
                    - https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation/203_xtend_expressions.html
                    - https://code.haxe.org/category/principles/everything-is-an-expression.html
                - We can use lambda calculus for imperative programming.
                    - Treat the statement separator (here we use semicolon `;`)
                    as an operator (function with infix syntax)
                    that sequences the effects of two expressions.
                        - For example:
                            - Let `a` be an expression.
                            - Let `b` be an expression.
                            - Thus `a;b` is an expression.
                            - The value of `a;b` is the value of `b`.
                            - The effect of `a;b` is the effect of `a` followed by the effect of `b`.
                        - Semicolon is associative: `(a;b);c = a;(b;c)`. This also holds for the effects.
                - Can we replace statements with expressions in existing imperative languages without breaking backward compatibility?

- Extending Haskell
    - Open ADTs (algebraic data types)
        - "Closed" means "defined in one place".
        - Open ADTs don't mix with exhaustive case analysis (function totality).

            - But what if functions are "open" too?
                - https://www.andres-loeh.de/OpenDatatypes.pdf
        - If `f : a -> b`, then the compiler should infer `lift f : (Monad m) => m a -> m b`.
    - Can we extend Haskell to "auto-fmap"?
        - Possibilities:
            - Add rewrite rules so that the compiler "recovers" from some type "errors".
            - Extend the syntax and semantics of function application.

            - Idea
                - Extend Haskell with "implicit injections".
                - The compiler should try in-scope injections automatically when there is a typing error, before quitting with a type error.
                    - Isn't this similar to Scala implicits and implicit conversion?
                        - I forgot who, but I think somebody on the Internet said that Scala implicits are a way for the compiler to recover from type errors.
                - Can we do this on GHC?

                        - GHC typechecker works on Haskell before it's transformed to Core.
                    - Write a plugin for GHC?
                        - Can a GHC modify the syntax tree on type error?
                    - Use GHC as library?
                    - We can't use GHC rewrite rules because they are only applied when optimization is enabled.
            - Define the concept of "expected type".
            - Let `e` be an expression.
            - Let `f : a -> b`.
            - Let `m` be an instance of Monad.
            - If `e` has type `a`, but the compiler expects `e` to have type `m a`, then the compiler shall rewrite `e` to `return e`.
            - If `e` has type `m a`, then the compiler rewrites `f e` to `map f e`.
        - If `x` is a Monad, then these are two *different* things: `x : a` and `return x`, but they are related, in the sense that they are equivalent, in the sense that one is trivially computable/derivable from the other.

- Every recursive type can be written as `mu a. F a` where F is the associated free functor?
    - Example: `List a = Fix (F a)` where `F a b = 1 + a * b`.
    - `Fix F = F (Fix F)` is the least fixed point of F.
- Haskell
    - language change proposals
        - Auto-lifting (and therefore sequencing) of function application involving Monad instances
            - The standard rule is:
                - If `x : a` and `f : a -> b`, then `f x : b`.
            - Suppose that `m` has a Monad instance.
                - If `x : m a` and `f : a -> b`, then should the compiler silently translate `f x` to `x >>= return . f`?
                    - Isn't it the only desirable way of putting together `f` and `x`?
                        - Monad class requires that `x >>= return . f` be equivalent to `fmap f x`.
                            - So there is really only one way to do it, isn't it?
                        - Examples of non-desirable ways: `unsafeCoerce`, `undefined`.
                - Should the compiler also appropriately translate `f x` for all these combinations?
                    - Possibilities for the type of `x`:
                        - `a`
                        - `m a`
                    - Possibilities for the type of `f`:
                        - `a -> b`
                        - `a -> m b`
                        - `m (a -> b)`
                        - `m a -> m b`
                        - `m a -> b`
            - At first glance it seems convenient, but what are the consequences?
                - Some I can think of
                    - Confusing error message
                        - Suppose:
                            - The programmer makes a typing mistake.
                            - The compiler infers the wrong type.
                            - The compiler performs translation based on the wrongly inferred type.
                            - The compiler produces a confusing error message.

- Should we use Haskell or TypeScript for this project? Both? Neither?
    - Killer features
        - IDE: TypeScript wins (VS Code).
        - custom infix operators: Haskell wins.
            - We can go even wilder with Agda, Coq, Idris, Lean, etc.
        - untagged unions: TypeScript wins.
        - software diversity: TypeScript wins.
            - TypeScript works with nodejs and npm. Boatloads of software.
            - I think TypeScript has more developers.
        - laziness
            - Haskell wins.

- What is a type?
    - Mathematically, A type is a set whose membership is syntactically decidable.
    - Engineeringly, A type gives meaning to bit patterns.
    A type encodes meaning into bit patterns.
        - For example, consider the bit pattern 11111111.
            - It means -1 as an int8.
            - It means 127 as an uint8.
