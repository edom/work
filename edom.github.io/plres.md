- The goal is to make *the* programming language.
- What are the criteria?
    - The language must be suitable for systems programming.
        - System programming is hardware-aware programming.
        Application programming assumes abstract machine, infinite memory, and all convenience provided by the operating system.
            - Why do we make this distinction?
    - In order for a language to be adopted, people must perceive its risk as low.
        - The language must work with existing codebases.
            - The language designer must think from the language user's point of view.
                - Let's say I have 100,000 lines of Java that I've been writing and testing for the past 5 years.
                Are you expecting me throw away all of them?
            - Thus the language must work with C, C++, C#, Java, Go, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and everything else.
            This should be possible because the essence of all programming languages is the same: every programming language is a formal system.
            It should be possible to translate a program P1 in language L1 to program P2 in language L2 with the same semantics.
            - Improve/enhance, not supersede.
        - Mixing the old and new languages should be easy.
        - 2013, article, "Empirical analysis of programming language adoption", [pdf](http://sns.cs.princeton.edu/docs/asr-oopsla13.pdf)
- A goal of programming language research is to make a better programming language (if not the best).
    - Do more with less.
    - *The* ultimate best programming language?
- Basic assumptions
    - Computer (machine) is embodied formal system.
        - Assume no hardware fault.
    - Software is executable mathematics.
- The [Sixten](https://github.com/ollef/sixten) language might be a good starting point.
- Every functional programming language is lambda calculus plus plus.
    - Every functional programming language L can be modeled by a category C(L) whose objects are the types of L and arrows are the function expressions of L.
    - I thought lambda calculus could be summarized in one page, but Henk Barendregt wrote hundreds of pages about it. Is there more to lambda calculus than it seems?

- syntax, grammar, parsing, pretty-printing
    - Parsing is the act of modifying the *state* of the parser.
        - 2017, ["A Typed, Algebraic Approach to Parsing"](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nk480/parsing.pdf)
            - "[...] we extend the notion of Brzozowski derivative from regular expressions to the typed context-free expressions."
    - Unparsing is the linearization (serialization) of a tree.
    - Parsing is the treeization (delinearization, deserialization) of a line.
    - Parsing is String -> Maybe Tree.
    - Unparsing is Tree -> String.
    - Can we make parsing truly one-to-one? String -> Tree. CST = AST. Very rigid syntax. Forbid whitespace freedom.
    - Why lex (lexical analysis / tokenization)?
        - Cleaner grammar (no need to mention whitespaces in the grammar).
            - Example:
                - With lexing: `exp ::= exp "+" exp`
                - Without lexing: `exp ::= exp white "+" white exp`.
        - https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Compiler_Construction/Lexical_analysis
            - "Strictly speaking, tokenization may be handled by the parser. The reason why we tend to bother with tokenising in practice is that it makes the parser simpler,
            and decouples it from the character encoding used for the source code."
    - given grammar, generate both parser and unparser/pretty-printer

                - JVM bytecode verification
                    - It's the compiler's job, not the VM's.
                    - Does it even add any security?

        - What I'm not sure about Java
            - Why type erasure?
                - C# 2.0 introduced generics, without type erasure, while maintaining backward compatibility.
                    - Duplicating everything in System.Collections to System.Collections.Generic is ugly, but it's less ugly than type erasure.

    - What I think every procedural programming language (Java, C, C++, Go, Python, Ruby) gets wrong, except JavaScript
        - Functions should be first-class. Methods should not exist. Fields are enough.
        - It should be possible to assign to methods.
        - `a.b()` should not mean "call method b of object a"
        - `a.b()` should mean "get the function a.b, then call it".
        - `a.b()` should mean `(a.b)()`.
            - `m = a.b; m();` should mean the same as `a.b()`.
        - JavaScript does this right.
        - What JavaScript does wrong, TypeScript does right.
    - What I think C and C++ got right but get wrong
        - In the 1970s these were tolerable (memory was limited; tools didn't exist). In 2018 these aren't tolerable.
            - Writing header files manually (should be generated from C files instead)
            - Preprocessor that works on text, not on C/C++ AST
    - What I think Haskell gets wrong
        - Template Haskell
            - Instead, we should have a metaprogramming library, and generate hs files.
        - Build is too slow.
            - Where should we fix this? GHC? Cabal?
    - What I think every imperative programming language gets wrong
        - Statements vs expressions
            - Statement should not exist. Only expressions should.
                - Xtend and Haxe do this right.
                    - https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation/203_xtend_expressions.html
                    - https://code.haxe.org/category/principles/everything-is-an-expression.html
                - We can use lambda calculus for imperative programming.
                    - Treat the statement separator (here we use semicolon `;`)
                    as an operator (function with infix syntax)
                    that sequences the effects of two expressions.
                        - For example:
                            - Let `a` be an expression.
                            - Let `b` be an expression.
                            - Thus `a;b` is an expression.
                            - The value of `a;b` is the value of `b`.
                            - The effect of `a;b` is the effect of `a` followed by the effect of `b`.
                        - Semicolon is associative: `(a;b);c = a;(b;c)`. This also holds for the effects.
                - Can we replace statements with expressions in existing imperative languages without breaking backward compatibility?
            - But C has https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_operator
- obscure

            - Is Dialyzer slow?
                - "My motivation for this is 95% of my bugs in Elixir/Erlang are due to using types wrong, like I may slightly change a tuple format somewhere but do not update it elsewhere and dialyzer does not catch it because the prior library state was in its cache that I then need to rebuild, in addition to dialyzer can take a long time to run."

            - The problem: Finding an XSD editor.
                - IntelliJ IDEA works for me, but I'd be happy if there is a lighter alternative.
