- Wanted: *replicable* magick experiments.
- Notes?
    - The presence of the experimenter affects the result?
    - The experiments may need to be repeated many times?
- Experiment ideas, ordered from the easiest to repeat:
    - Extrasensory perception
        - Astral projection
            1. Get a person (A) who can astral-project.
            1. Generate a bit X.
            1. Ask A about X.
        - Dream precognition
            - Telepathy
                1. Get two telepathic people A and B. (If you are telepathic yourself, you can be any one of them.)
                1. Generate a bit X (0 or 1) that only you and A know.
                1. Let A telepathically tell X to B. (Take care to isolate each of you to avoid sensory leakage.)
                1. Ask B about X.
        - Spirit possession
            - Procedure:
                1. Get two mediums A and B. (If you are a medium yourself, you can be A.)
                1. Get A to summon a spirit S.
                1. Generate a bit X (0 or 1) that only you and A know.
                1. Let A tell X to S.
                1. Get S into B. (This needs more detail.)
                1. Ask the S-possessed B about X.
                If he/she consistently knows, we may have a support for dualism.
                1. Get S out of B.
            - If the experiment result is promising,
            we can test the spirit's working memory capacity
            by replacing the bit X with a string, a number, a sentence, or whatever longer.
            The only important constraint is that you need to pick an X
            that is easy to remember but hard to guess.
            - Problems:
                1. Mediation may be tiring? (Can get another medium?)
                1. Spirits may refuse to cooperate? (Can get another spirit?)
    - Joint micropsychokinesis
        - What if many people try to influence a RNG at once?
        So far experiments one person influences a RNG at a time.
        Does the effect add up?
            - Is there even any effect at all?
- We might dismiss one person for hallucinating.
Two unrelated honest people corroborating each other are less likely to be hallucinating.
The more people say the same thing, the more serious the claim is.
Not necessarily more true, but surely more serious.
Most people are not pathological liars.
    - The facts may be correct, but the explanation may be unjustified.

- From the ghost's point of view, it is we who are haunting them, not they who are haunting us.
Or is it not that simple?

    - I was too scared to view some materials at night. I did these:
        - Play "Yakety Sax" in the background.
        - Surf the Internet with my sister.
