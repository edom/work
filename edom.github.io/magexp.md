- Wanted: *replicable* magick experiments.
- Notes?
    - The presence of the experimenter affects the result?
    - The experiments may need to be repeated many times?
- Experiment ideas, ordered from the easiest to repeat:
    - Extrasensory perception
        - Astral projection
            1. Get a person (A) who can astral-project.
            1. Generate a bit X.
            1. Ask A about X.
        - Dream precognition
            - Telepathy
                1. Get two telepathic people A and B. (If you are telepathic yourself, you can be any one of them.)
                1. Generate a bit X (0 or 1) that only you and A know.
                1. Let A telepathically tell X to B. (Take care to isolate each of you to avoid sensory leakage.)
                1. Ask B about X.
        - Spirit possession
            - Procedure:
                1. Get two mediums A and B. (If you are a medium yourself, you can be A.)
                1. Get A to summon a spirit S.
                1. Generate a bit X (0 or 1) that only you and A know.
                1. Let A tell X to S.
                1. Get S into B. (This needs more detail.)
                1. Ask the S-possessed B about X.
                If he/she consistently knows, we may have a support for dualism.
                1. Get S out of B.
            - If the experiment result is promising,
            we can test the spirit's working memory capacity
            by replacing the bit X with a string, a number, a sentence, or whatever longer.
            The only important constraint is that you need to pick an X
            that is easy to remember but hard to guess.
            - Problems:
                1. Mediation may be tiring? (Can get another medium?)
                1. Spirits may refuse to cooperate? (Can get another spirit?)
    - Joint micropsychokinesis
        - What if many people try to influence a RNG at once?
        So far experiments one person influences a RNG at a time.
        Does the effect add up?
            - Is there even any effect at all?
