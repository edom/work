- Design your text so that the reader can read it continuously and can resume arbitrarily.
    - A page should be finishable in one sitting (about 15 minutes perhaps?).
    - Links?
        - Links should be clumped together, not scattered.
            - Links distract. They break the continuity/immersion of the reading.
    - Design the branching points such that readers understand what to expect by following the links.
- Difference
    - No progress indicator.
        - On paper, your hand tells you how far you are from the end of the book.
        - On screen, you have no idea where you are.
    - No position indicator.
        - On paper, you can mark a page and resume reading later.
        - On screen, you can bookmark a page.
    - Navigation: linear vs tree
        - On paper, navigation is mostly linear: you go to the next page.
        Occasionally you jump to the table of contents.
        - On screen, navigation is tree.
            - Following links depth-first risks forgetting the original context.
            - Following links breadth-first risks browser tab count explosion.
- Which feels better: flip pages of paper, or navigate several hyperlinks?
