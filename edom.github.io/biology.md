    - What is digital "immortality"?
        - You teach computers your thoughts.
        Then they mimic you.
        People can interact with "you" through computers.
        Then "you" would be digitally "immortal".
        But you'll still die.
        "You" is the machine's model of you.
        - It's like hiring someone to imitate you for life.
        - Is it legit?
            - [Wikipedia: Digital immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_immortality)
    - Can we reach immortality by replacing all organs (except the brain) with artificial organs?
- Does fasting help someone heal from a disease?
    - Hypothesis: it might help healing because when you not don't eat, your body's immune system can focus on fighting the disease.
    - Hypothesis: it might worsen the disease because your body doesn't get enough nutrient to fight the disease.
    - Hypothesis: it might have no effect.

- What is trans fat? Why is trans fat bad?
    - [WP:Trans fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat)
        - "trans-unsaturated fatty acid"
- How is trans fat generated?
    - [WP:Trans fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat)
        - "Fats contain long hydrocarbon chains, which can either be unsaturated, i.e., have double bonds, or saturated, i.e., have no double bonds. In nature, unsaturated fatty acids generally have cis as opposed to trans configurations.[5] In food production, liquid cis-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties, e.g. they melt at a desirable temperature (30–40 °C). Partial hydrogenation of the unsaturated fat converts some of the cis double bonds into trans double bonds by an isomerization reaction with the catalyst used for the hydrogenation, which yields a trans fat.[2][3]"

    - Starch vs fiber
        - Both are polysaccharides (chain of monosaccharides).
        - Starch has alpha-bonds. Can be cleaved by human digestive enzymes.
        - Fiber has beta-bonds. Humans can't digest.

    - nutrition
    - hypertrophy is due to microfracture healing
        - microfracture is due to contraction that is
            - challenging (harder than the muscle's comfort zone)
            - eccentric (shortening the muscle: flexing the muscle while it is extended/stretched out)
