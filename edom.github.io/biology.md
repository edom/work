- How do we cure death?
- How do we live forever?
- Why do we age?
- Why don't limbs regrow after amputation?
- How do we reverse-engineer the genetic code?
- If we want to live forever, then which should we bet on: biology or artificial intelligence?
    - What is digital "immortality"?
        - You teach computers your thoughts.
        Then they mimic you.
        People can interact with "you" through computers.
        Then "you" would be digitally "immortal".
        But you'll still die.
        "You" is the machine's model of you.
        - It's like hiring someone to imitate you for life.
        - Is it legit?
            - [Wikipedia: Digital immortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_immortality)
    - Can we reach immortality by replacing all organs (except the brain) with artificial organs?
- Does fasting help someone heal from a disease?
    - Hypothesis: it might help healing because when you not don't eat, your body's immune system can focus on fighting the disease.
    - Hypothesis: it might worsen the disease because your body doesn't get enough nutrient to fight the disease.
    - Hypothesis: it might have no effect.
- bacteriophage might help us fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria

    - nutrition
    - hypertrophy is due to microfracture healing
        - microfracture is due to contraction that is
            - challenging (harder than the muscle's comfort zone)
            - eccentric (shortening the muscle: flexing the muscle while it is extended/stretched out)
