  - Every branch is a highly specialized subfield.
  - Two branches are likely mutually unintelligible.

    - Tissot's indicatrices visualize a metric tensor by scattering
      many circles throughout a space
      so that we can see how the space's metric tensor distorts them.
      This method tells us how much our map is lying to us.

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_knowledge_management][WP:Mathematical knowledge management]]
  - I think we can go a long way by presenting every knowledge in "X is a Y" form.
    Something is almost always something else.
    Everything is almost always similar to something else.

- Real numbers

  - Between two real numbers, there exists real numbers.

    - $\forall a, z \in \Real; a < z :$

      - $\exists m \in \Real : a < m < z$
