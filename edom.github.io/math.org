** Relation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: relation
   :END:

An example ordered pair is $(a,b)$. It is not the same as $(b,a)$.

A /relation/ $r$ is a triple $(A,B,R)$ where
$A$ is a set called the /domain/,
$B$ is a set called the /codomain/,
and $R \subseteq A \times B$ is a set that is the relation's /mapping/.
Such mapping is a set of ordered pairs.

Iff $(a,b) \in R$, then we say that $r$ /relates/ $a$ /to/ $b$.
The word "to" implies that direction is important.

A relation is not just a subset of a Cartesian product.
The domains and codomains matter.

** Function
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: function-1
   :END:

A /function/ is a relation in which each element of the domain is related to /exactly one/ thing.

Let $f = (A,B,F)$ be a function.

The notation of "applying $f$ to $x$", written $f(x)$,
means the $y$ such that $(x,y) \in F$.

** Partial functions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: partial-functions
   :END:

A /partial function/ is a relation in which each element of the domain is related to /at most one/ thing.
If you replace "at most one" with "exactly one", you get the definition of a function.

If a partial function $f$ does not relate a domain element $x$ to anything,
then we say that $f(x)$ is /undefined/.

The symbol $\bot$ is called /bottom/.

We can /totalize/ a partial function $f = (A,B,F)$ into a total function $f_\bot = (A,B_\bot,F_\bot)$
where $B_\bot = B \cup \\{ \bot \\}$, and we require that $\bot \not\in B$,
and, for each $a \in A$:
1. if $(a,b) \in F$, then $(a,b) \in F_\bot$;
2. otherwise, $(a,\bot) \in F_\bot$.

What is the difference between "undefined" and "bottom"?
The "bottom" of a set $B$ is /defined/ as something that is not equal to anything in $B$.
On the other hand, something "undefined" is /not defined/ at all,
for example the result of $1 / 0$.
Thus, we should /not/ write $f(x) = \bot$ to mean that $f(x)$ is undefined.

[[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/partial+function][ncatlab: partial function]]

The function $f : A \to B$ has input type $A$ and output type $B$.

** Function equality
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: function-equality
   :END:

- Two relations are /equal/ iff

  - their domains are equal,
  - their codomains are equal, and
  - their mappings are equal.

- Formally, $(A_1,B_1,R_1) = (A_2,B_2,R_2)$ iff

  - $A_1 = A_2$,
  - $B_1 = B_2$, and
  - $R_1 = R_2$.

- Functions are relations.

  - Equality of functions is equality of relations.

- Intension vs extension

  - Consider:

    - $f : \Nat \to \Nat$, ( f(n) = n + n ),
    - $g : \Nat \to \Nat$, ( g(n) = 2 \cdot n ).

  - Observe:

    - They are extensionally equal: $f(n) = g(n)$ for all $n$.
    - They are not intensionally equal: $f \neq g$.
    - Their outputs match, but they are not the same function.

  - Problem:

    - When do we care about intension?
    - Do we ever care at all?

* Limit
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: limit
  :END:

We motivate the definition of the limit of a sequence.

A /sequence/ $s$ consists of the elements $s_0$, $s_1$, and so on, possibly endlessly.
The notation ( s = ( 1/n )/{n=1}^{\infty} ) means the sequence
\begin{align*}
s_1 &= 1/1,
\\ s_2 &= 1/2,
\\ s_3 &= 1/3,
\end{align*}
and so on where $s_n = 1/n$ for each integer $n$ greater than or equal to one.
The index does not have to begin with one.
For example, the notation ( ( n^2 )/{n \in \Nat} ) means the sequence
\begin{align*}
s_0 = 0^2,
\\ s_1 = 1^2,
\\ s_2 = 2^2,
\end{align*}
and so on where $s_n = n^2$ for each $n$ in $\Nat$.
Unless indicated otherwise, an index is a natural number, which begins from zero.
Instead of using indexes such as $s_n$, we can also use brackets $s[n]$,
and we can even use parentheses $s(n)$.
We define $S(A)$ to be the image of $A$ through $s$,
that is the set of all possible outputs of $s$,
that is the set ( { x _{|} a \in A, ~ s(a) = x } ).
The set $S(A)$ is obtained by applying $s$ to each element of $A$,
that is, if ( A = { a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots } ), then ( S(A) = { s(a_1), s(a_2), s(a_3), \ldots } ).
Let $A$ be a set from which the sequence elements are taken.
Let $A$ also has a partial order $\le$.
The statement $\beta \le \alpha$ can also be written $\alpha \ge \beta$.
The notation $s(k)$ suggests that a sequence can be thought of as a function $\Nat \to A$.
Due to the partial order, we can define an /upper bound of $s$/ as a $z$ such that $s_n \le z$ for all $n$,
and we can define a /lower bound of $s$/ as an $a$ such that $s_n \ge a$ for all $n$.
The /supremum/ of $s$ is its least upper bound.
The /infimum/ of $s$ is its greatest lower bound.
If and only if the infimum $\inf s$ and the supremum $\sup s$ have the same value $L$,
then we say that $s$ /converges/ to $L$,
and we say that the /limit/ of $s$ is $L$,
and we write $\lim s = L$.

Note that the bounds do not have to occur in the sequence itself.

If we have a sequence $s$,
then we can apply a function $f$ to each member of $s$
to create a new sequence $t_n = f(s_n)$.
Every function can be /lifted/ into a function that works on sequences
by applying that original function to each element of the sequence.

Now that we have defined the limit of a sequence,
we can now define the limit of a function /as its input approaches a value/.
Let $f$ be a function.
By saying "the input of $f$ approaches $a$",
we mean that there exists a sequence $x$ that converges to $a$.
We define the /limit/ of a function $f$ as its input $x$ approaches $a$ to be $L$, written $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$,
if and only if for every sequence $u$ that converges to $a$,
the limit of the sequence ( \lim (f(u_n))_{n \in \Nat} = f(a) ).

Another way we can define $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ is by the epsilon-delta definition of limit
as done by Cauchy, Bolzano, and Weierstrass.

A /generalized sequence/ is a function from an index set $I$ to an element set $A$,
where the index has an ordering $\le$.

* Learning mathematics
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: learning-mathematics
  :END:

- Setting the attitude

  - "Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them."
    John von Neumann (1903--1957) ([[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann][source]])
  - Mathematics is English and some rules (or whatever your language is).
    People who can understand English can get used to mathematics (with effort).
  - Mathematics is a tower of concepts.
  - Mathematics is a chain of concepts.
  - Mathematics is a tree of concepts.

- Definitions

  - /Definitions/ are important.
    Your first reaction when you encounter an unknown word should be "What's its definition?"
    For example, a /group/ is a set and a binary operation satisfying the group axioms.
    If you're new, your questions should be "What is a set?",
    "What is a binary operation?",
    and "What are the group axioms?",
    and then you should search them on the Internet.
    (Don't do it right now; it's just an example.)
  - Read the definition.
    Try to use the definition.
    Find some examples.
    You will forget.
    It's OK.
    Read them again later after you forgot.
    It takes several times of forgetting to get used to it,
    and eventually you'll get a feel of it.
    You /must/ expect to forget, because forgetting is part of learning.
  - Mathematicians invent new words to do more with less words.
    It's more efficient to say "$G$ is a group"
    than write the group axioms in full every time a group needs to be declared.

- Notation

  - A /mathematical notation/, like the Latin alphabet,
    is a way of writing English (or whatever your language is).
    When you read "math",
    you are really reading the same language
    that you speak everyday.
  - When you encounter symbols in a sentence,
    think about how they should read in English
    to make the whole sentence grammatically correct.
  - Mathematical notations also have slangs and inconsistencies, just like English.
    We're human after all.
  - An /equation/ $A=B$ means you can change
    every $A$ with $B$, and every $B$ with $A$,
    everywhere you find them, as long as the context is still the same.
  - *Don't hate the notation.*
    Used properly, it saves your time and others' time.
  - *Note:* Please memorize the 48 symbols in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet#Letters][Greek alphabet]]
    (24 capital letters and 24 small letters).

* Relation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: relation
  :END:

The /arity/ of a relation is its number of parameters.
For example, if $A$ has arity 2, then $A(x,y)$ is a /formula/.

Relations of arity 0, 1, and 2 are also called /nullary/, /unary/, and /binary/, respectively.

A /constant/ is a nullary relation.

A /set/ is a unary relation.
We can write either $A(x)$ or $x \in A$ to mean that $x$ is an /element/ of the set $A$.

What is the difference between a relation and a predicate?

A pedantic note:
Theoretically, a formula is not a truth value,
and it is the /interpretation/ that maps formulas to truth values.
For example, if $A$ is a unary relation,
then $A(x)$ is a formula, not the truth value,
and therefore it does not make sense to say "$A(x)$ is true".
Practically, the interpretation is implicit, and we say "$A(x)$ is true" to mean "the implied interpretation maps $A(x)$ to truth value 1".

** Binary relations

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_rewriting_system][rewriting system]],
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph][directed graph]] (digraph).

Every binary relation $A$ is also a /directed graph/
where $(x,y)$ is an edge iff $A(x,y)$.
We will mix terms.
For example, a relation is /acyclic/ iff its graph is acyclic.

Let $A$ be a binary relation.

Iff $A(x,y)$, then $x$ is in the /domain/ of $A$.

Iff $A(x,y)$, then $y$ is in the /range/ of $A$.

$x$ /reaches/ $y$ ($y$ is /reachable/ from $x$)
iff there is a path from $x$ to $y$.

$x$ is /initial/ iff its in-degree is zero (no $y$ satisfying $A(y,x)$).

$x$ is /terminal/ iff its out-degree is zero (no $y$ satisfying $A(x,y)$).

The /composition/ of $A$ and $B$ is $A \circ B$
where ( (A \circ B)(x,y) = \exists m ( B(x,m) \wedge A(m,y) ) ).
Note the swap: first $B$ maps $x$ to $m$,
and then $A$ maps $m$ to $y$.
Function composition is special case of relation composition.

The /$n$th self-composition/ of $A$ is ( A^n = A \circ A^{n-1} ).

The /infinite self-composition/ of $A$ is ( A^\infty ),
the smallest relation satisfying $A \circ A^\infty = A^\infty$.
We also say that $A^\infty$ is the /least fixed point/ of $F$ where ( F(X) = A \circ X ).

The /transitive closure/ of $A$ is the union of all self-compositions of $A$.
Formally, ( tc(A) = \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty A}k ).

* Unary algebra
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: unary-algebra
  :END:

A /mono-unary algebra/ $(A,f)$ is a set $A$ and a unary function $f : A \to A$.

There is always an injection from a unary algebra $(A, f)$
to the /magma/ $(A, F~f)$
where $F~f~x~y = f~x$.
The binary operation $F~f$ ignores its second argument.
This magma happens to also be a noncommutative /semigroup/:
if we let $g = F~f$, then $g~(g~x~y)~z = g~x~(g~y~z)$.
Therefore the variety of unary algebras is isomorphic
to a subvariety of magmas.

There is also always an injection from a magma $(A, g)$
to the unary algebra $(A^2, G~g)$
where $G~g~(x,y) = (g~x~y, ~ y)$.
The unary operation $G~g$ passes through the second component.

If $A$ is infinite,
there is always a bijection between $A$ and $A^2$.

If $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality,
then for each injection $m : A \to B$ and function $f : A \to A$,
there is always a $g : B \to B$ such that $m~(f~x) = g~(m~x)$.
More understandably,
$$
f~x = y \iff g~(m~x) = m~y
$$

If $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality,
then for each function $f : A \to A$,
there is always an injection $m : A \to B$
and a function $g : B \to B$ such that $m~(f~x) = g~(m~x)$.

If $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic (have the same cardinality),
then the variety of $A$-unary algebras and the variety of $B$-unary algebras are isomorphic.

/The variety of $A$-unary algebras/
is the set of all unary algebras whose underlying set is $A$.

*Lemma:* There is always an isomorphism between two varieties of unary algebras
whose underlying sets have the same cardinality.

*Corollary:* if $A$ is infinite, then the variety of $A$-unary algebras
and the variety of $A^2$-unary algebras are isomorphic.

If $A$ is infinite,
there is always a bijection $m : A \to A^2$
such that $m~(f~x) = g~(m~x)$.

If $A$ is infinite,
then there is always an injection from a unary algebra $(A^2,f)$
to the unary algebra $(A,g)$.

If $A$ is infinite,
then there is always a bijection between
a unary algebra $(A,f)$ and a unary algebra $(A^2,g)$,
for every $f$ and $g$.

Lemma: If there is a bijection between $A$ and $B$,
there is also a bijection between $2^A$ and $2^B$.
(Axiom of choice?)

http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/243590/bijection-from-mathbb-r-to-mathbb-rn

Lemma: If there is a bijection between $A$ and $B$,
there is also a bijection between $A \to A$ and $B \to B$.
(Since $(A \to A) \subset 2^A$).

Conclusion: there is an isomorphism between the set of $(A,f)$s and the set of $(A^2,g)$s.

A homomorphism from $(A, f)$ to $(B, g)$ is $h : A \to B$ such that
$h~(f~x) = g~(h~x)$.

Let there be these structures:

- The unary system $(A, f)$ where $f : A \to A$.
- The fixpointed unar $(A, f, p)$ where $f~p = p$.
- The magma $(A, g)$ where $g : A \to A \to A$.
- The semigroup $(A, g)$ where $g$ is associative.
- The semigroup $(A, g, a)$ with left-absorbing element $a$.
- The unar $(A^2, h)$ where $A^2 = A \times A$.

A fixpoint in the unar becomes a left-absorbing element in the magma.

The semigroup is non-commutative: $F~f~x~y \neq F~f~y~x$.

Therefore there is a homomorphism from
the algebra of unary systems to the algebra of non-commutative semigroups.

A left-absorbing element in the binar becomes
the left component of a fixpoint in the unar.
$$
(g~p~y, ~y) = (p,y) = h~(p,y)
$$

Another way to embed:
$$
\begin{align*}
(g~x~y, ~ g~y~x) = h~(x,y)
\\ (g~p~y, ~ g~y~p) = (p, ~ f~y) = h~(p,y)
\\ (g~x~p, ~ g~p~x) = (f~x, ~ p) = h~(x,p)
\end{align*}
$$

Flip, like negation:
$$
m~(x,y) = m~(y,x)
$$

Lemma: If $c$ is a cardinal number, then $c! = 2^c$.
