- How do we reboot human knowledge from zero?
    - There are some ways in which everything might be destroyed:
        - the next world war
        - the next big space object impact
    - We must survive.
        - Find, gather, and follow the survivalists.
            - [WP:Survivalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivalism)
        - We must drink.
            - Settle near a clean river.
        - We must eat.
            - Forage.
                - Hunt some game/meat.
                - Gather edible plants.

            - How do we forage with less effort?
                - Weapon. Sharp edges.
                - Fire. Cooking.
                - Husbandry. Raise. Farm. Ranch. Agriculture. Crops.
        - Try to restore some of the Internet (Google, Wikipedia) before the survivalists die???
