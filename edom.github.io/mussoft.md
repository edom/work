- Constraints
    - Stay as close as possible to a default Debian or Ubuntu installation.
    - Use as much libre software as practical.
- Target audience
    - People who have some technical knowledge and are willing to work.
- We are using Ubuntu 14.04, but in 2019 we might switch to [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) 9.
    - Alternative: Ditch plain Debian/Ubuntu
    and just use [KXStudio](http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/).
- I am using
    - MuseScore 2, music typesetting program.
    Doesn't come with Ubuntu 14.04, but has an AppImage
    downloadable from the MuseScore website.
    - Things that come with Ubuntu 14.04
        - ALSA
        - PulseAudio
        - Totem media player
- I use sometimes
    - Things that come with Ubuntu 14.04 (probably very outdated)
        - Audacity (2014 version).
        It often hangs when I click the pause button.
        Don't use to record live.

        - JACK Rack, for stacking parametric equalizers
        - ZynAddSubFX generates nice warm rich pads
