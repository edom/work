- Reading sky map to find celestial objects
    - Other names: star chart, star map, sky map
    - [WP:Celestial sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere)
    - The sky looks as if it were projected to a spherical screen?
    - If a space object is far enough, it will look as if it were fixed in the sky.
    - Suppose you found something in the sky.
    How do you tell your friends where that thing is?
    How do you tell them where to look at in the sky?
        - Use *equatorial coordinate system*: Right ascension, Declination, and Epoch
            - Example: Alpha Centauri A. ([WP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri))
                - Right ascension 14 h 39 m 35.06311 s
                - Declination -60 deg 50 min 15.0992 sec
                - Epoch J2000
            - [WP:Epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(astronomy))
                - J2000 is the Gregorian date 2000-01-01 12:00 TT (terrestrial time).

    - Equatorial coordinate system
    - Still unanswered: How to read star chart? What are equatorial coordinates?
- Distance
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec
    - 1 au (astronomical unit) is roughly the distance between the Sun and the Earth.
        - 1 au is about 150 million km.
        - 1 au is about 6 light minutes.
    - 1 ly is 1 light year.
        - It's a unit of length, not time.
            - A *light year* is the distance traveled by light in one year.
    - Parsec is also a unit of length.
    - 1 pc is about 3.26 ly.
- Objects, ontology, hierarchy?
    - planet
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution
        - star
            - "A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity."
            - Every star begins from collapsing clouds of gas and dust?
            - A star is a self-sustaining fusion nuclear reactor.
                - [WP:Stellar nucleosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis)

            - supernova
            - brown dwarf
            - white dwarf
        - solar system
            - "sol" is Latin word for "sun"

        - nebula
        - constellation (con + stella)
            - "stella" is Latin word for "star"
            - "constellation" means "bunch of stars"
