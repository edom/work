* On the language we use for the mind-body problem
First we must define some words such as "mind", "self", "consciousness".
Then, we make a-priori inferences, by language only, based on those definitions.
Then, only after we have agreed on those definitions, do we begin to seek a-posteriori knowledge
by looking for such things in reality.

The way we use words implies relationships.
Our language implies some mereological commitments.

Our usage of English suggests that /minds contain thoughts/ and brains contain brain matter,
because it feels wrong to substitute "What's in your mind?" with "What's in your brain?"
Thoughts are a kind of /mental content/[fn::<2019-09-02> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind].
We think that a mind /contains/ thoughts in the way a box contains things.
It implies that a mind has a /boundary/.

The next question: Does the mind merely /contain/ thoughts, or does it also /generate/ them?
** Consciousness is the ability to know
/Consciousness/ is the ability to know.

Something is /conscious/ iff it /can know/.

While I'm sleeping, I'm /unconscious/ (I have /low consciousness/), because I can only know very little while I'm sleeping.

I have /more consciousness/ when I'm awake than when I'm asleep,
because I /can know more/ when I'm awake than when I'm asleep.

Why are we so sure that a rock doesn't know anything?

On the etymology of the word "conscious",
[[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conscious][Wiktionary]]
says that it comes from Latin "con-" (together) and "scire" (to know).

Defining consciousness as "the ability to know" raises two questions:
What does it mean to /know/ something?
What does it mean to be /able/ to do something?
Those questions are the questions that epistemology aims to answer.
Thus defining consciousness requires epistemology.
*** How do we measure consciousness (ability to know)?
How do we measure whether X has more consciousness than Y?
*** Hypothesis: Consciousness requires sense, memory, and feedback.
This hypothesis assumes materialism.
This will be false if it turns out that consciousness is fundamental in Nature.

- Imagine something.
- Imagine that you are imagining something.
- Imagine that the imagined you are in turn imagining something else.
  Is this even possible?
- To manipulate your consciousness,
  you must consciously intend to manipulate your consciousness.
  Can you consciously manipulate your consciousness?
- Consciousness needs sensory input.
- Consciousness needs feedback.
- Self concept needs feedback.
- If there is not a feedback, a system cannot distinguish itself from its environment.
  The self concept will never arise.
- If a brain can immediately control a thing,
  then that thing is part of the brain's self concept.
  If the brain can't, it's not.
- If a brain often gets certain input shortly after it produces certain output,
  it will associate the output with its self concept.
- The self is the thing under conscious control.
- It seems that:
  - Consciousness requires sense.
  - Consciousness requires memory.
  - Consciousness requires feedback.
- It seems that consciousness is (itself, or is caused by?)
  the feedback of information from the immediate past.
**** Memory is necessary but not sufficient for consciousness.
- If I don't have memory, I can't bunch my past self and my present self into the same identity.
**** Identity?
- Cutting off the legs of a person does not change the identity of that person.
  All of his memories are intact.
  Veterans who lost their legs in war retains their pre-war memories.
- Some brain damage changes the identity of the person.
**** Prerequisites of consciousness?
- What is /necessary/ for consciousness?
  - Thought experiment: If someone is born without any senses, it cannot be conscious?
  - Thought experiment: Of an average adult, if all motor nerves are cut, and all sensor nerves are intact,
    then he is conscious intensionally but not extensionally?
    - If we cut all efferent nerve connections,
      the person will behave the same as the one in vegetative coma.
      If we remove the prefrontal cortex,
      the person will still show vital signs, but will be vegetative.
  - Infer: Consciousness has something to do with the brain. (What is it?)
    - Observe: A brain-damaged person does not exhibit conscious behavior.
    - Assume: Philosophical zombie does not exist.
    - Assume: Trapped consciousness does not exist.
    - [[https://www.quora.com/Can-consciousness-exist-without-sensory-inputs][Quora: Can consciousness exist without sensory inputs?]]
      - dissociative anesthesia? ketamine? sensory deprivation tank?
  - Assume: There is no experiment that can decide between these two things:
    the absence of consciousness, and the absence of efferent nerves?
  - Assume: My consciousness is tied to my body.
  - Assume: When I sleep, my consciousness pauses.
- What is /sufficient/ for consciousness?

**** How does consciousness arise? How are these different things of the same person related? Which requires which?
- His brain.
- His mind / thought / soul / spirit.
- His behavior. (His externally visible behavior.)
- His memory.
- His identity.

The questions:
- Which can exist without which?
- Which requires which?
  Which suffices which?
  Which is necessary but not sufficient for which?
  Which is sufficient for which?

** On mind, dream, and hallucination
Where is this book?
https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/dreaming

https://aeon.co/philosophy/philosophy-of-mind

https://aeon.co/science/quantum-theory

We can dream.

We turn our attention into the dreams we can remember but not control.
Are those hallucinations?

Hypothesis: Dreams /are/ hallucinations (that happen while sleeping).
I hypothesize that dreams and hallucinations are the same class of phenomenons.

What Is the Link Between Hallucinations, Dreams, and Hypnagogic–Hypnopompic Experiences?
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4988750/

* Is psychology science?
There are psychological experiments and theories that try to explain those experiments, but do those theories predict anything?

Is psychology falsifiable?

There are some interesting experiments and applications.
Asch conformity experiment,
Stanford prison experiment.
Using stories to change minds.
Hostage negotiation techniques.
Pavlovian conditioning, Skinnerian conditioning.
Rat heaven experiment.
Monkey mother experiment.
/But what is the underlying science?/
Biology, genetics, hormones, epigenetics, neuroscience, and so on.

Psychology can be thought of as applied biology.

Everyone capable of some empathy has an intuitive understanding of basic psychology.
* On subjective experience
** TODO What /has/ subjective experience?
** TODO What /can/ have subjective experience?
** TODO How does subjective experience arise?
Does subjective experience arise from matter?

Why do I happen to be this particular subjective experience among other billions of possible subjective experiences?

A subjective experience is a point of view (from which a being perceives).

Consciousness is not subjective experience.

Being conscious doesn't mean having subjective experience.

Being conscious doesn't mean having a mind.

"Total synthesis" means what is described in the Wikipedia article of the same title. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_synthesis

"Molecular assembly"

Suppose that we total-synthesize a fertilized egg, and we place that egg in a womb.
Then that egg will grow.
The egg doesn't care about its history.

Suppose that John is an average 30-year-old man.
We can snapshot his chemical configuration at a point in time.
From that snapshot, we can recreate the chemical configuration that constitutes John at that point in time.
We can total-synthesize a replica of John.
But this replica would have different subjective experience.
The original John also continues to exist.

Existence doesn't require subjective experience.
The virtual people in the game "The Sims" doesn't have subjective experience.
(Do they!?)

By now I would have concluded that brain controls mind, if I hadn't heard of Pim van Lommel's near-death experiments.

I want to believe that the brain control the mind, but there are Pim van Lommel's near-death experiments.

An outlandish explanation attempt: interfering parallel universes.
There is a parallel universe where Pim told his patients.
That universe interferes with our universe.

Scientists have assembled a bacterium.

A newborn fails the self-awareness test.

A system is self-aware means that a system know its self or itself?

Does a newborn have subjective experience?

How does subjective existence arise?

Don't conflate "consciousness" and "subjective experience". Consciousness is the ability to know. Your subjective experience is your first-person view.

Does an imaginary person have a real subjective experience? (Does this question even make sense?)

Does a sim in the game "The Sims" have a subjective experience?

JTB theory:
Is it possible to believe something true but for the wrong reason?
So what?

** Tononi's IIT implies that we are not simulations
What is the problem with this argument?

If Tononi's IIT is true, then we are not simulations.
(Does Tononi's IIT imply that consciousness cannot be simulated by a computer program?)

Modus tollens.
If I am a simulation, then I don't have subjective experience.
But I have subjective experience.
Therefore I am not a simulation.

* On the interaction between mind and brain
We know that mental stress can induce somatic illness.

How do I distinguish between these two cases?
- I was conscious before I was born but I have no memory of it
- I was not conscious before I was born

I know that I exist.
I think I existed a few seconds ago because I have a memory of that.
But how do i know that I /existed/ a few hours ago?
My memory is only an extremely simplified representation of what my past self perceived.

Can a conscious being be unaware of itself, its own existence?

Memory is necessary for consciousness?

Hypothesis: A brain /traps/ consciousness.
** On mind-body interaction experiments
Sperry, Libet, mentalism, and non-materialism

What can we infer from these experiments?
What are they trying to tell us?

(Are there other scientific experiments?
Search "consciousness experiments" on the Internet.)

We want to infer from these things:
- the relationship between these concepts:
  - volition
  - imagination, hallucination, illusion, delusion
  - wake, sleep, dream
  - intrusive thoughts

There is an idea that "Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality" (your brain hallucinates your subjective experience)
 [fn::https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/6rqq11/your_brain_hallucinates_your_conscious_reality/].

TODO Read Liber's "A testable field theory of mind brain interaction"

Relevant phenomenons, experiments, reports, and cases:
- Phineas Gage changed after brain accident
- French civil servant with missing brain https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oXoMYJIvJ4
  - "A man in France continues to puzzle scientists nearly a decade after he was found to be living with just 10 percent of a typical human brain."
  - "Despite the reduced brain matter, the man lived a relatively normal life; he was a married civil servant with two kids.
    He also scored an IQ of 75 which is considered low but not disabled."
- Baby born without forebrain

Transcranial magnetic stimulation[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation] shows that some physical change on the brain affects subjective experience of the mind.
The question: does the /same/ magnetic stimulation cause the /same/ change in subjective experience?

Brain study, psychedelics, and anesthetics:
We still don't know how psychedelics and anesthetics work.
*** TODO Is intrusive thoughts voluntary?
*** TODO What I think we know?
** On /involuntary/ mind-brain interaction
Here we classify mind-brain interaction by /origin/ and /voluntariness/.

We know that some changes in the brain cause some changes in the mind,
and some changes in the mind cause some changes in the brain.

Hallucination is when brain confuses input and output?

I have experienced these first-hand:
- sleep paralysis: when going from sleep to wake, can move eyes, can breathe, but can't move other muscles, not even speak
- hypnagogic jerk: the feeling of falling when going from wake to sleep

<2018-11-07>
The difference between imagination and hallucination is /voluntary of existence/.
We can start imagining at will.
We can stop imagining at will.
We cannot start hallucinating at will.
We cannot stop hallucinating at will.
"At will" means "voluntarily", that is, "by volition".

Example.
I can imagine an elephant for three seconds, and then stop imagining it.
But, if I eat a psychedelic mushroom,
I can't stop the hallucination by sheer will,
but eventually my brain chemistry returns to normal and the hallucination ends.

Imagination: mind affects brain.
Hallucination: brain affects mind.

This explains why people can't die /just by wanting/ to die:
because the mind does not fully control the brain.

How do we complete this table?

|                    | can we start it at will? | does it require our will (conscious mental effort) to start? | can we stop it at will? | origin |

** What is not mind?
*** Autonomous nervous system is not part of mind
Consider my ANS (autonomic nervous system).

My brain controls my ANS.
My mind does not control my ANS (I don't know how).

Thus, my ANS is a part of /my brain's/ self, but my ANS is not a part of /my mind's/ self.

However, both my mind and my brain are parts of /my/ self.

My mind has only very small control over my brain.
The involuntary processes are much bigger than the voluntary processes.
**** <2018-11-06> We usually conflate /someone/ and /someone's mind/.
These questions usually mean the same thing:
- What do /you think/?
- What's /in your mind/?

That equivalence implies that your mind is a part of you or belongs to you.

However, when we insult, we say "Use your brain!", not "Use your mind!"

***** Why does subjective experience exist?

Why does subjective experience exist?
- The same functional area of different brains are located at the same spot. We can predict the effect of damaging certain areas of the brain. Thus there is a common principle that determine how all brains work.
- Everyone seizures when electrical-shocked. This implies that all muscles work the same way.

** Brain
*** What does the brain do?
*** Learning, attention, synchronicity, correlation, causality
The brain learns by directing attention to unusual synchronicities, and suspecting causality in that synchronicity.
The interestingness of an event is proportional to the amount of attention paid to that thing.
The interestingness of an event is inverse to our belief of its likelihood.

We see that A happens soon after B, and we retry that experiment, and we see the same thing.
Thus we suspect that A causes B.

We are bad at looking at long-term causality.
We are bad at traversing chain of causes.
We can only see immediate consequences.

Our tendency to create complex systems that exceed our ability to understand it will doom us.
** Psychosoma-electromagnetism analog?

and some changes in the mind cause some changes in the brain.

** On the implications of integrated information theory on systems with conscious components
What does integrated information theory imply about the consciousness of a system that consists of conscious components,
such as a /group/ of people, such as an organization?

We can think of an organization as behaving like an organism.
** Is there an atomic theory for abstract objects?
Is there an atomic theory for the objects that exist in the mind?

In formal logic, an /atom/ is an irreducible proposition, usually represented by a Latin letter.

What does it mean to divide a thought into two?

** Can a mind control multiple bodies?

What?
"First model for General Causality: Artificial Intelligence Breakthrough"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9sAERoMfC0

The brain is good at detecting correlation.

We create causal model from local correlation.
By "local", we mean happening in almost the same space and at almost the same time.
