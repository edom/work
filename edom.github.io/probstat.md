# Probability and statistics

"Probstat" is "probability and statistics".

- Basic probability modeling
    - Model coins and dices, both fair and biased, and combination
    - Multiple coin tosses
    - Conditional probability
    - Bayes rule
        - Sensitivity and specificity
        - False positive and false negative
        - Testing the test
    - Counting exhaustively
        - Monty Hall problem
        - [WP: Boy-or-girl paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_or_girl_paradox) (need unambiguous problem statement)
    - Basic combinatorics (counting combinations)
    - Randomness
- Basic statistics
    - Collection? Dataset? Sample?
    - Variable vs parameter
    - Collect data
    - Design a survey
        - Avoid leading questions ([WP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_question))
        - Avoid loaded questions ([WP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_question))
    - [WP: Statistical data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_data_type)
    - Calculate descriptive statistics
- More rigor
    - Measure theory
    - Continuous probability
- Where should these be? How should we organize this?
    - Determining coin fairness
    - Random variable
        - Not a variable, and not random?
    - Inferential statistics
        - Infer something about the population from samples.
        - How do we sample the population correctly?
        - Case study: election "quick count" or "exit poll"
    - Estimation
        - Bias
        - Point estimation
        - Likelihood
            - Maximum likelihood estimation?
    - Fitting
        - Consider replacing "regression" with "fitting".
        - Line fitting with one independent variable
    - Random process
    - Random walk
    - Stochastic integral
    - Markov process
    - How do we interpret very small probabilities?
    - Expectation, expected value
    - Distribution
    - Normal distribution
    - Central limit theorem
    - Renewal theory
    - Decision theory

        - [WP: Secretary problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem)
    - Betting
    - Bookmaking

## Education

- Probability or statistics first?
    - [Stats SE 219733: What should be taught first: Probability or Statistics?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/219733/what-should-be-taught-first-probability-or-statistics)
    - [Quora: Should I study probability or statistics first? Why?](https://www.quora.com/Should-I-study-probability-or-statistics-first-Why)
    - Probability, statistics, sample, and population
        - Probabilistic modeling: assume population, infer sample
        - Inferential statistics: gather sample, infer population
    - http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~skiena/jaialai/excerpts/node12.html
        - Probability looks to the future. Statistics looks to the past.
            - Just like finance and accounting.
