Meta-research is research about research.
See also [Wikipedia: Meta-research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-research).

To onboard newcomers faster,
we should write living documents that summarize papers and provide directions.
Living documents are perfect for expository works.

Stick to the Web.
Use Markdown, HTML, CSS.
Use MathJax if you need to typeset math on the web.
Yes, it's uglier than LaTeX,
but, for the reader,
reading HTML pages has less friction
than reading a PDF document.

Every research paper is a "delta" of knowledge, a "nugget", a "diff".
We need living documents that are the sum of those deltas.

The problem is:
who are the authors of a collaborative living document?

To research, ask:
- What questions should we ask?

## Academic journal publishing reform

Remember Aaron Swartz.

Library Genesis.

Which mailing lists should I join?

Which blogs, websites, or people should I follow?

## On reading papers

Only read papers or books after you know what you are looking for.
Don't read without reason.

## What tools might help my research?

[learn-anything.xyz](https://learn-anything.xyz/) is a community-curated mind map.

Google's [talk to books](https://books.google.com/talktobooks/).

vixra.org

I have not used any of these.

## Proposal for academic publishing reform: Separate peer review and physical dissemination

Make a website for peer-reviewing articles.

Change the incentive structure for professors:
incentivize them to publish openly (such as on preprint servers) instead on closed journals.

What is important is not where an article is published,
but *who reviews the article*.
What is important is "this article was reviewed by <an important researcher>",
not "this article was published on <an important journal>".

Reputation should be attached to reviewers, not journals.

## Open access journals

How do we know if an open-access journal is legitimate?

## How should we write?

Researchers should collaborate writing living documents instead of writing isolated papers.
We need something like Wikipedia but for research.
Wikiversity might be close to that.

## How do we know what others have done?

A person has *narrow* interests,
if we compare it to all possible interests.

I think, today, in a research group,
there has to be someone dedicated to finding resources (papers, books)
that might be related to the group's research,
because this job is huge,
given today's flood of information.

Given no further information,
we should prefer newer resources to older resources.

Given no further information,
we should put more trust on people
who have spend more time researching the topic.

### How do we find papers?

Use Google to find papers.
Add `filetype:pdf` to your query.

To find theses and dissertations, use [OATD](https://oatd.org/) (open-access theses and dissertations).
To find a UK PhD thesis, use [EThOS](http://ethos.bl.uk/Home.do) (e-theses online service).

To find papers and citations, use Google Scholar or
[Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org).

### Where are expository works?

All research needs more expository works.
https://mathoverflow.net/questions/15366/which-journals-publish-expository-work

[Arxiv math history and overview](https://arxiv.org/archive/math.HO)

These journals contain expository works.
Unfortunately these journals are Elsevier journals.
[Expositiones mathematicae](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/expositiones-mathematicae/).
[Computer science review](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computer-science-review).
