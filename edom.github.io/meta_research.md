## Questions

- How to research?
    - Ask research questions, answer them, and collect them into living documents.
    - Slides, Simon Peyton-Jones, ["How to write a great research paper: seven simple suggestions"](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/icfp-plmw15/slides/peyton-jones.pdf).
    There is [a copy on Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/).
- In order to do something new, you must make sure that nobody else has done it.
In 2018, there are 7 billion people.
- Which country values science the most?
Where is scientist most demanded?
    - [WP: Inglehart--Welzel cultural map of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inglehart%E2%80%93Welzel_cultural_map_of_the_world)
    - [phdstudies.com: What are the best countries for scientists?](https://www.phdstudies.com/article/What-Are-The-Best-Countries-For-Scientists/)
    - [OECD better life index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD_Better_Life_Index)
- What is the best place to do research?
    - Find the leading researcher, and go there?
- What is meta-research?
    - Meta-research is research about research.
    See also [Wikipedia: Meta-research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-research).
- How should I structure my research?
    - Structure your research as a hierarchy of questions and answers.
    Every question may spawn child questions and answers.
    I call this format the HQA (Hierarchical Questions and Answers) or QAT (Question-Answer Tree).
        - We should group paragraphs into trees.
            - Every child explains, augments, supports, or elaborates its parent.
            - We have been grouping sentences into paragraphs.
    - Why do we need questions or problems?
        - Questions drive research.
- How do we onboard newcomers faster?
    - Write *living documents* that summarize papers and provide directions.
    Let them improve it.
    Living documents are perfect for expository works.
        - Every research paper is a "delta" of knowledge, a "nugget", a "diff".
        We need living documents that are the sum of those deltas.
        - A possible problem: who are the authors of a collaborative living document?
- What computer document format should I publish my research in?
    - Stick to standard Web technology.
    Write your content in Markdown.
    Use MathJax if you need to typeset math on the Web.
    Let a program convert it to HTML.
    Use CSS to style your document.
    - Why should I stick to those?
        - For the reader, reading HTML pages has less friction than reading a PDF document.
    - Why should I not follow your advice?
        - Your institution probably incentivizes you to publish on famous journals, not on the Internet.
        This incentive scheme has to change for better science.
        Unfortunately you are not in the position to change it.
        It's frustrating.
- How do we use journals?
    - What are the journal article types?
    What kinds of articles do journals publish?
        - [Editage's six journal article types](http://www.editage.com/insights/6-article-types-that-journals-publish-a-guide-for-early-career-researchers): original research; review article; clinical case study; clinical trial; perspective, opinion, and commentary; book review
        - There are also letters, monographs, surveys, and retractions.
- How should we organize information?
    - It depends on how the information is going to be retrieved.
    - [The only five ways to organize information](http://thevisualcommunicationguy.com/2013/07/20/the-five-and-only-five-ways-to-orgaize-information/):

## On reading papers

Only read papers or books after you know what you are looking for.
Don't read without reason.

## Open access journals

How do we know if an open-access journal is legitimate?

http://www.mdpi.com/journal/universe

https://benthamopen.com/PHY/home/

## How should we write?

Researchers should collaborate writing living documents instead of writing isolated papers.
We need something like Wikipedia but for research.
Wikiversity might be close to that.

## How do we know what others have done?

A person has *narrow* interests,
if we compare it to all possible interests.

I think, today, in a research group,
there has to be someone dedicated to finding resources (papers, books)
that might be related to the group's research,
because this job is huge,
given today's flood of information.

Given no further information,
we should prefer newer resources to older resources.

Given no further information,
we should put more trust on people
who have spend more time researching the topic.

- How do we find papers?
    - To find papers and citations, use Google Scholar or
    [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org).
    - Use Google to find papers.
    Add `filetype:pdf` to your query.
    - To find theses and dissertations, use [OATD](https://oatd.org/) (open-access theses and dissertations).
    To find a UK PhD thesis, use [EThOS](http://ethos.bl.uk/Home.do) (e-theses online service).
    - Where are expository works?
        - [MO 15366: Which journals publish expository work?](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/15366/which-journals-publish-expository-work)
            - These journals contain expository works.
            Unfortunately these journals are Elsevier journals.
            [Expositiones mathematicae](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/expositiones-mathematicae/).
            [Computer science review](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computer-science-review).

- Can we outsource master-level or doctorate-level research to Fiverr or Amazon Mechanical Turk?

    - Is the difficulty in mathematics essential or accidental?
        - accidental complexity is due to bad notation, bad presentation, bad writing

            - Each vertex should not have more than 7 children.
        - The practical structure is graph.
