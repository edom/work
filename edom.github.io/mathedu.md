- Bad teachers make students hate the subject being taught.
    - Bad math teachers make students hate math.
    - Bad teachers waste humans, brains, the future of nations, the future of humanity.
        - How many people *can* think but *won't* because their teachers suck?
            - How many people *can* do math but *won't* because their math teachers suck?
- Textbooks should answer "Why should I care?"
- Everywhere in mathematics is *logic*.
    - Everything is a consequence of the definitions.
    - Everything that is true has always been true.
        - It's just that we haven't proved it.
- Calculus should be taught with infinitesimals (instead of delta-epsilon)?
    - Pros
        - more intuitive
        - simplifies probability theory
    - Cons
        - some topology (and perhaps some other advanced mathematics) uses delta-epsilon

        - "This article argues that first semester calculus courses for non-mathematics majors
        should be taught using infinitesimals."
