* Goals, non-goals, and target audience
This is about survival, but not hardcore survival.

This is about practical 21st century food sovereignty.

This is /not/ about:
- survival in the wilderness
- isolating ourselves from the rest of the world
- rejecting technology

We assume these about the reader:
- The reader knows some basic chemistry.
- The reader lives in a crowded city.
- The reader has limited starting capital of no more than USD 10,000 or IDR 100,000,000 in 2018 currencies.
* Tentative plans
** TODO Estimate costs, expenses, incomes, and return. Study the feasibility of 10-square-meter potted garden.
*** TODO Find the most profitable plants. Find the plants with the highest ROI.

I haven't read UU narkotika.
I think it's too risky for an Indonesian citizen to sell cannabis, even indirectly.
***** Hypothetical case studies
- X is an Indonesian citizen.
- X stays (resides) in Indonesia.

What are the consequences of these cases?
****** An Indonesian citizen owning a cannabis farm outside Indonesia
- X plants cannabis in another country whose law allows farming cannabis.
****** An Indonesian citizen owning a foreign company that sells cannabis
- X owns a foreign company that sells cannabis.
  X doesn't sell it himself; his company sells it.
  The company resides in a country that allows selling cannabis.
- The company is a private limited liability company.

Does the Indonesian law consider X as an accessory/accomplice?

I'm thinking of rectangular drainable prismatic plant pots because they are affordable, practical, space-efficient, and movable.

* Understanding some botany
** Terms, jargons, ontologies, taxonomies, classifications, differences, groupings
/Botany/ is the study of plants.

A /plant/ is ...
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant

Most plants /photosynthesize/.

A /vegetable/ is an edible plant.

A /fruit/ is to a plant as an egg is to a chicken.

Plant anatomy

Plant physiology
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_physiology
*** Cotyledons: monocots vs dicots
I think monocots are harvestable sooner.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotyledon
*** Softwood vs hardwood
- Softwood is gymnosperm (monocot) wood.
- Hardwood is angiosperm (dicot) wood.
- Softwood isn't always softer than hardwood.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softwood
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardwood
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicotyledon#Comparison_with_monocotyledons
*** Gymnosperm (naked-seed) vs angiosperm (bottled-seed)
*** Evergreen vs deciduous
/Deciduous/ ("tending to fall off") trees shed leaves in autumn.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous

/Evergreen/ trees have some leaves through winter.
*** Vegetable vs herb vs bush vs grass
*** Bean vs lentil vs nut vs pulse vs legume vs pea
*** Fruit vs berry vs accessory fruit
** Nutrient cycle
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient_cycle
*** Thinking of a plant as a system of interacting chemical processes
We can think reductionistically:
- The input is sunlight, carbon dioxide, nitrogen/nitrates, magnesium, water, and some other trace elements.
- The output is mostly solid hydrocarbon polymers (lignins, celluloses, starches, fibers, sugars, carbohydrates) and gaseous oxygen.
- The variables are temperature.
*** Carbon cycle variants and plant resilience: C3, C4, and CAM plants
Most plants are C3 plants.
https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/photosynthesis-in-plants/photorespiration--c3-c4-cam-plants/a/c3-c4-and-cam-plants-agriculture
** What is soil, and how does it form?
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedology
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedogenesis
*** Checking topsoil quality
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topsoil#Evaluation
** Minimum soil depth for growing beans?
** Plant physiology, homeostasis, limiting factor
* Growing the vegetables we eat
** Theory
*** Plants don't need soil. Plants need nutrients.
*** What triggers germination/sprouting?
Germination is sprouting.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germination

Germination doesn't require light.
Growing requires light.
*** How much area do we require to feed a person?
Assume:
- A vegetable requires an area of 20 x 20 cm2.
- A vegetable grows from seed to harvestable in 9 months.
*** What vegetables we are going to eat? How much?
Most vegetables grow from seed to harvest in less than 9 months.

*** What triggers flowering and fruiting? Are there juvenile (not-yet-fertile) and adult (fertile) plants?
*** Beans (lentils?) capture nitrogen from air and store it in their roots.
*** Cycles, mainly nutrient cycles
**** Carbon cycle
**** Nitrogen cycle
**** Water cycle
*** Urine is a good source of nitrates for the plants?
*** Mulching
**** What is a mulch; what is it made of
A /mulch/ is a thin cover over the topsoil.

A mulch can be made of:
- woodchips/barkdust (chips/shreds of tree barks) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barkdust,
- hay (dried grass/herbs), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hay
- straw (dried cereal stalks) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw
- dead plants / dead leaves.
**** Why mulch; the purpose; denying wind-borne weed seeds
A mulch prevents wind-borne weed seeds from landing and germinating,
but doesn't prevent the seeds buried in the topsoil from germinating.

A mulch also prevents topsoil erosion.

A mulch can be penetrated from below but not from top.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulch
- https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulsa
- https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manajemen_hama_terpadu
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_pest_management

Should you remove old mulch?
This [[https://www.cardinallawns.com/2016/02/mulching-remove-old-mulch/][article]] basically says it depends.
*** Climate and growing season
- Tropical climate has dry season and rainy season.
- Four-season climate has spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
- A greenhouse is a climate-controlled environment.
- <2018-10-09> Weather is unpredictable nowadays.
*** These plants assume grassland biomes?
** Options for beginners
*** Raised-bed garden
*** Recommended: plant pots plus composts: ideal movability
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowerpot

"How to Grow Lettuce in Containers - Complete Growing Guide" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZJD4lu9vOY
50 lettuces in a pot.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_irrigation

/Spray/ the pot, don't /inundate/ it.
Inundation leaches (washes away) nutrients.

*** Composting food leftovers
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compost
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthworm

But what about chicken and cow hormones and antibiotics leaching into the soil, and taken up by the plants that we eat?
*** Hydroponic kit
*** Yard (often unfeasible in crowded cities such as Jakarta where land price varies from IDR 2,000,000 to 50,000,000, per m2)
How long do you get IDR 10,000,000 from one-square-meter garden?

- Someone gets IDR 400,000 per week from a 300 m2 land ([[http://www.tribunnews.com/regional/2014/06/07/bertani-organik-lahan-300-meter-hasilkan-rp-400-ribu-tiap-minggu][source]]).
  That is IDR 20,800,000 per year.
  That is absurdly low IDR 69,333 per m2-year.
*** Buy a truck, van, box-mobile, lorry, or mini-bus, and plant on vehicle rooftop or load
** Designing/planning the schema of the data that we want to collect / the experiments we want to do, and how we are going to store it
- tables in org-mode files seem ideal
- CSV files: easy setup, but can't put comments
- SQL database: cumbersome setup, but can put comments
** Building the infrastructure
Raised-bed garden?
** Don't grow rice yourself. It doesn't make sense economically. You can't beat the government's economy of scale.

- Establish the ability to feed the people depending on labor and independent from rupiah.
- Obtain personal/group sovereignty by securing the ability to live by depending only on nature
*** Why
Those who can survive on their own have power over those who can't.

Everyone needs food.
Those who control food control the society.

You can always sell food (convert food into money).
The inverse isn't always true: you can't always buy food (convert money into food).

Nature feeds those who work.

Nature accepts labor as payment.
Nature doesn't accept money.
