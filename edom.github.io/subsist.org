* Goals, non-goals, and target audience
This is about survival, but not hardcore survival.

This is about practical 21st century food sovereignty.

This is /not/ about:
- survival in the wilderness
- isolating ourselves from the rest of the world
- rejecting technology

We assume these about the reader:
- The reader knows some basic chemistry.
- The reader lives in a crowded city.
- The reader has limited starting capital of no more than USD 10,000 or IDR 100,000,000 in 2018 currencies.

I haven't read UU narkotika.
I think it's too risky for an Indonesian citizen to sell cannabis, even indirectly.
***** Hypothetical case studies
- X is an Indonesian citizen.
- X stays (resides) in Indonesia.

What are the consequences of these cases?
****** An Indonesian citizen owning a cannabis farm outside Indonesia
- X plants cannabis in another country whose law allows farming cannabis.
****** An Indonesian citizen owning a foreign company that sells cannabis
- X owns a foreign company that sells cannabis.
  X doesn't sell it himself; his company sells it.
  The company resides in a country that allows selling cannabis.
- The company is a private limited liability company.

Does the Indonesian law consider X as an accessory/accomplice?

** TODO Buy plant pots/containers.
I'm thinking of rectangular drainable prismatic plant pots because they are affordable, practical, space-efficient, and movable.

Should we use grow bags?

Should we use used plastic bags (those supermarket ones), punch some holes in it?

Downsides:
- The bag may /topple/.
- Sunlight /degrades/ polymers.

* Business plan and feasibility analysis
** Nutrient cycle steady-state self-sufficiency analysis: how much bok choy can my shit alone grow?
- Assumptions
  - The person shits every day.
  - The person eats 100 gram of bok choy every day.
  - A bok choy plant takes 60 days to grow from seed to harvest.
    - https://homeguides.sfgate.com/long-bok-choy-grow-83118.html
  - A bok choy harvest weighs 300 grams.
    - https://www.cookipedia.co.uk/recipes_wiki/Broccoli assumes that each broccoli head weighs 225 grams.
    - http://cnas-re.uog.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bok-Choy_02_23_18-Proof-3.pdf
  - A bok choy plant grows linearly at 5 grams per day.
  - <2018-10-26> 1,000 grams of bok choy sells for IDR 25,000.
  - Growing one gram of bok choy plant requires one gram of shit.
- Therefore, in the steady-state, the person shits just enough to continuously grow 20 bok choy plants in parallel.
  - Every 60 day, harvest 6000 grams of bok choy, and sell it for a total of IDR 150,000.
- If the person wants at least IDR 6,000,000 of monthly income selling bok choys, then he must sell 240 kg of bok choys.

Formula:
- Closed loop nutrient cycle assumption: how much you eat every day = the amount of plant mass your shit is going to grow.
- Nutrient conservation assumption: energy from sunlight + the mass of your shit = the mass of your daily food.
  We can derive this from the conservation of energy.
  We assume that sunlight is unlimited.
  - For example, if you eat 100 grams of bok choy and 100 grams of garlic every day,
    then your daily shit is enough to feed 100 grams of bok choy and 100 grams of garlic every day.

*** Bean vs lentil vs nut vs pulse vs legume vs pea
*** Fruit vs berry vs accessory fruit
** Nutrient cycle
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient_cycle
*** Thinking of a plant as a system of interacting chemical processes
We can think reductionistically:
- The input is sunlight, carbon dioxide, nitrogen/nitrates, magnesium, water, and some other trace elements.
- The output is mostly solid hydrocarbon polymers (lignins, celluloses, starches, fibers, sugars, carbohydrates) and gaseous oxygen.
- The variables are temperature.
*** Carbon cycle variants and plant resilience: C3, C4, and CAM plants
Most plants are C3 plants.

*** Plants don't need soil. Plants need nutrients.
*** What triggers germination/sprouting?
Germination is sprouting.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germination
  - "Seed germination depends on both internal and external conditions.
    The most important external factors include right temperature, water, oxygen or air and sometimes light or darkness."

The factors determining germination:
- moisture (not soaking)

Germination doesn't require light.
Growing requires light.

Search the Internet:
- plant germination database
- seed germination database
- seed information database
*** How much area do we require to feed a person?
Assume:
- A vegetable requires an area of 20 x 20 cm2.
- A vegetable grows from seed to harvestable in 9 months.
*** What vegetables we are going to eat? How much?
Most vegetables grow from seed to harvest in less than 9 months.

*** What triggers flowering and fruiting? Are there juvenile (not-yet-fertile) and adult (fertile) plants?
*** Beans (lentils?) capture nitrogen from air and store it in their roots.
*** Cycles, mainly nutrient cycles
**** Carbon cycle
**** Nitrogen cycle
**** Water cycle
*** Urine is a good source of nitrates for the plants?
*** Mulching
**** What is a mulch; what is it made of
A /mulch/ is a thin cover over the topsoil.

A mulch can be made of:
- woodchips/barkdust (chips/shreds of tree barks) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barkdust,
- hay (dried grass/herbs), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hay
- straw (dried cereal stalks) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw
- dead plants / dead leaves.
- animal bedding litter, usually made of log waste; pasir yang dipakai untuk tempat hewan peliharaan buang kotoran https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V20X4Hyexhs
**** Why mulch; the purpose; denying wind-borne weed seeds
A mulch prevents wind-borne weed seeds from landing and germinating,
but doesn't prevent the seeds buried in the topsoil from germinating.

A mulch also prevents topsoil erosion.

A mulch can be penetrated from below but not from top.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulch
- https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulsa
- https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manajemen_hama_terpadu
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_pest_management

Should you remove old mulch?
This [[https://www.cardinallawns.com/2016/02/mulching-remove-old-mulch/][article]] basically says it depends.
*** Climate and growing season
- Tropical climate has dry season and rainy season.
- Four-season climate has spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
- A greenhouse is a climate-controlled environment.
- <2018-10-09> Weather is unpredictable nowadays.
*** These plants assume grassland biomes?
** Options for beginners
*** Raised-bed garden
*** Recommended: plant pots plus composts: ideal movability

How long do you get IDR 10,000,000 from one-square-meter garden?

- Someone gets IDR 400,000 per week from a 300 m2 land ([[http://www.tribunnews.com/regional/2014/06/07/bertani-organik-lahan-300-meter-hasilkan-rp-400-ribu-tiap-minggu][source]]).

** Can a plant get too old to be sold?
** What plants should we grow?
*** First, grow what you eat.
*** Then, grow the plants with the highest ROI (return on investment).
** Planting process standard
- The only thing we want to measure: ROI.
- Record the date of sowing.
- Record the date of harvest.
- Record all transactions.
- Accounting per species.
* <2018-10-09> Naive newbie botanist assumption: Just spread seeds, and everything will grow by itself.
* Secure the food for the family (at least 5 people)
** Some reasoning
- Establish the ability to feed the people depending on labor and independent from rupiah.
- Obtain personal/group sovereignty by securing the ability to live by depending only on nature
*** Why
Those who can survive on their own have power over those who can't.

Everyone needs food.
Those who control food control the society.

You can always sell food (convert food into money).
The inverse isn't always true: you can't always buy food (convert money into food).

Nature feeds those who work.

Nature accepts labor as payment.
Nature doesn't accept money.

Chickens are more complex organisms than algae,
