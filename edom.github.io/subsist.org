* Goals, non-goals, and target audience
This is about survival, but not hardcore survival.

This is about practical 21st century food sovereignty.

This is /not/ about:
- survival in the wilderness
- isolating ourselves from the rest of the world
- rejecting technology

We assume that the reader knows some basic chemistry.

* Understanding some botany
** Terms, jargons, ontologies, taxonomies, classifications, differences, groupings
/Botany/ is the study of plants.

A /plant/ is ...
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant

Most plants /photosynthesize/.

A /vegetable/ is an edible plant.

A /fruit/ is to a plant as an egg is to a chicken.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_fertility

Plant anatomy

Plant physiology
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_physiology
*** A plant can be thought as a system/process
- The input is sunlight, carbon dioxide, nitrogen/nitrates, magnesium, water, and some other trace elements.
- The output is mostly solid hydrocarbon polymers (lignins, celluloses, starches, fibers, sugars, carbohydrates) and gaseous oxygen.
- The variables are temperature.
*** Carbon cycle variants and plant resilience: C3, C4, and CAM plants
Most plants are C3 plants.
https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/photosynthesis-in-plants/photorespiration--c3-c4-cam-plants/a/c3-c4-and-cam-plants-agriculture
*** Cotyledons: monocots vs dicots
I think monocots are harvestable sooner.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotyledon
*** Softwood vs hardwood
- Softwood is gymnosperm (monocot) wood.
- Hardwood is angiosperm (dicot) wood.
- Softwood isn't always softer than hardwood.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softwood
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardwood
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicotyledon#Comparison_with_monocotyledons
*** Gymnosperm (naked-seed) vs angiosperm (bottled-seed)
*** Evergreen vs deciduous
/Deciduous/ ("tending to fall off") trees shed leaves in autumn.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous

/Evergreen/ trees have some leaves through winter.
*** Vegetable vs herb vs bush vs grass
*** Bean vs lentil vs nut vs pulse vs legume vs pea
*** Fruit vs berry vs accessory fruit
** Nutrient cycle
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient_cycle
** Bioindicators
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioindicator
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_species

Guard plant
Sentinel plant
Indicator plant
pH indicator plant

https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/info/plant-indicator-info.htm
** What is soil, and how does it form?
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedology
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedogenesis
*** Checking topsoil quality
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topsoil#Evaluation
** Minimum soil depth for growing beans?
** Plant physiology, homeostasis, limiting factor
* Growing the vegetables we eat
** Theory
*** Plants don't need soil. Plants need nutrients.
*** What triggers germination/sprouting?
Germination is sprouting.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germination

Germination doesn't require light.
Growing requires light.
*** How much area do we require to feed a person?
Assume:
- A vegetable requires an area of 20 x 20 cm2.
- A vegetable grows from seed to harvestable in 9 months.
*** What vegetables we are going to eat? How much?
Most vegetables grow from seed to harvest in less than 9 months.

*** What triggers flowering and fruiting? Are there juvenile (not-yet-fertile) and adult (fertile) plants?
*** Beans (lentils?) capture nitrogen from air and store it in their roots.
*** Cycles, mainly nutrient cycles
**** Carbon cycle
**** Nitrogen cycle
**** Water cycle
*** Urine is a good source of nitrates for the plants?
*** Mulching
Should you remove old mulch?
This [[https://www.cardinallawns.com/2016/02/mulching-remove-old-mulch/][article]] basically says it depends.

*** Climate and growing season
- Tropical climate has dry season and rainy season.
- Four-season climate has spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
- A greenhouse is a climate-controlled environment.
- <2018-10-09> Weather is unpredictable nowadays.
*** These plants assume grassland biomes?
** Options for beginners
*** Raised-bed garden
*** Pots
*** Hydroponic kit
*** Yard (often unfeasible in crowded cities such as Jakarta where land price varies from IDR 2,000,000 to 50,000,000, per m2)
How long do you get IDR 10,000,000 from one-square-meter garden?

- Someone gets IDR 400,000 per week from a 300 m2 land ([[http://www.tribunnews.com/regional/2014/06/07/bertani-organik-lahan-300-meter-hasilkan-rp-400-ribu-tiap-minggu][source]]).
  That is IDR 20,800,000 per year.
  That is absurdly low IDR 69,333 per m2-year.
*** Buy a truck, van, box-mobile, lorry, or mini-bus, and plant on vehicle rooftop or load
** Designing/planning the schema of the data that we want to collect / the experiments we want to do, and how we are going to store it
- tables in org-mode files seem ideal
- CSV files: easy setup, but can't put comments
- SQL database: cumbersome setup, but can put comments
** Building the infrastructure
Raised-bed garden?
** Don't grow rice yourself. It doesn't make sense economically. You can't beat the government's economy of scale.
- According to [[https://www.kompasiana.com/bang_buan/5516d6e9813311ab64bc5fa7/swasembada-pangan-atau-kesejahteraan-petani][source]]:

No money, but lots of assets.

*** Shitology (What is the formal name?)
**** What is the nutritional value of our shit?
**** How do we recycle our shit? How do we return our shit to nature, so that plants can take it up, but without contaminating our drinking water?
*** Technofarming contrary to my beliefs
In farming, I want us to invest more in ecological engineering than in computers.
I think these companies go against my beliefs.

*** Then, grow the plants with the highest ROI (return on investment).
High price, but what is the ROI?

- https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/picking-your-plant-portfolio--book-reveals-the-roi-of-homegrown-vegetables-300237341.html

What?
ROI in dollars?
ROI is unitless.
Does the writer know what he/she is talking about?
https://www.diynetwork.com/made-and-remade/make-it/top-10-value-veggies-to-plant
** Planting process standard
- The only thing we want to measure: ROI.
- Record the date of sowing.
- Record the date of harvest.
- Record all transactions.
- Accounting per species.
* <2018-10-09> Naive newbie botanist assumption: Just spread seeds, and everything will grow by itself.
* Secure the food for the family (at least 5 people)
** Some reasoning
- Establish the ability to feed the people depending on labor and independent from rupiah.
- Obtain personal/group sovereignty by securing the ability to live by depending only on nature
*** Why
Those who can survive on their own have power over those who can't.

Everyone needs food.
Those who control food control the society.

You can always sell food (convert food into money).
The inverse isn't always true: you can't always buy food (convert money into food).

Nature feeds those who work.

Nature accepts labor as payment.
Nature doesn't accept money.

* Old content
- How many square meters of land do we have?
- How many grams of green pea does a square meter of land yield?
- How much space does a chicken need?
- How much food does a chicken need every day?

Combine animal husbandry / ranching and permaculture to make low-operation organic chicken farm?
** Seaweed
Nori is edible seaweed species of the red algae genus /Pyropia/ ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nori][Wikipedia]]).
/Porphyra/ is known as nori in Japan
([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laver_(seaweed)][Wikipedia again]]).
What?
Which is right?
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phycology][Phycology]] is the study of algae.
It turns out [[http://www.seaweed.ie/aquaculture/noricultivation.php][nori cultivation is hard]].
Chickens are more complex organisms than algae,
but why is raising algae harder than raising chickens?
