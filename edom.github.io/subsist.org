* Goals
This is about survival, but not hardcore survival.
** Non-goals
This is /not/ about:
- survival in the wilderness
- isolating ourselves from the rest of the world
- rejecting technology
Farming is good for everyone with IQ from 80 to 140.

Tanaman paling cuan?

Jakarta farmer's market?
Jakarta seed market?

Plants, from the easiest to grow:
- pioneer species, grasses, bamboo
- vegetables
- rhizomes
- difficult: fruit-bearing trees, dicots, tall plants

Evolution, fruit, edibility

* What
** Plants don't need soil. Plants need nutrients.
** How much area do we require to feed a person?
Assume:
- A vegetable requires an area of 20 x 20 cm2.
- A vegetable grows from seed to harvestable in 9 months.
** What vegetables we are going to eat? How much?
Most vegetables grow from seed to harvest in less than 9 months.

** Beans (lentils?) capture nitrogen from air and store it in their roots.
** Basic ontology
A /plant/ is ...
Most plants /photosynthesize/.

A /vegetable/ is an edible plant.

A /fruit/ is to a plant as an egg is to a chicken.
*** Evergreen and deciduous
/Deciduous/ ("tending to fall off") trees shed leaves in autumn.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous

/Evergreen/ trees have some leaves through winter.
*** Bean vs lentil vs nut
*** Fruit vs berry vs accessory fruit
** Cycles, mainly nutrient cycles

Kemandirian.
Self-reliance.
Independence.
No money, but lots of assets.

- Buy a land.
- Establish permaculture/do-nothing-farming.

*** Shitology (What is the formal name?)
**** What is the nutritional value of our shit?
**** How do we recycle our shit? How do we return our shit to nature, so that plants can take it up, but without contaminating our drinking water?
*** Technofarming contrary to my beliefs
In farming, I want us to invest more in ecological engineering than in computers.
I think these companies go against my beliefs.

** Secure the land; prevent landslide and soil liquefaction
** <2018-10-07> Build roads, towns, houses, and cities.
A house should be movable.
* Secure the food for the family (at least 5 people)
** Some reasoning
- Establish the ability to feed the people depending on labor and independent from rupiah.
- Obtain personal/group sovereignty by securing the ability to live by depending only on nature
*** Why
Those who can survive on their own have power over those who can't.

Everyone needs food.
Those who control food control the society.

You can always sell food (convert food into money).
The inverse isn't always true: you can't always buy food (convert money into food).

Nature feeds those who work.

Nature accepts labor as payment.
Nature doesn't accept money.

* Old content
- How many square meters of land do we have?
- How many grams of green pea does a square meter of land yield?
- How much space does a chicken need?
- How much food does a chicken need every day?

Combine animal husbandry / ranching and permaculture to make low-operation organic chicken farm?
* Seaweed
Nori is edible seaweed species of the red algae genus /Pyropia/ ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nori][Wikipedia]]).
/Porphyra/ is known as nori in Japan
([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laver_(seaweed)][Wikipedia again]]).
What?
Which is right?
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phycology][Phycology]] is the study of algae.
It turns out [[http://www.seaweed.ie/aquaculture/noricultivation.php][nori cultivation is hard]].
Chickens are more complex organisms than algae,
but why is raising algae harder than raising chickens?
