- Habits learned the hard way
    - I check the time at [time.gov](https://time.gov/) because Ubuntu 14.04 NTP once betrayed me.
        - 2018-01-16: I had always thought that it was dependable, but it betrayed me:
        It showed 2 a.m. while the actual time was 4 a.m..
        I missed some hours of sleep.
