April fools' day is harmful.

Pranks are harmful.

[Gmail mic drop April fools' day prank](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/04/01/gmails-mic-drop-april-fool-backfires-costing-people-their-jobs/)
is [a stupid idea](http://www.businessinsider.co.id/google-pulls-mic-drop-minions-april-fools-joke-due-to-complaints-job-losses-2016-4/#.Vv43px_I7Qo), and also a harmful one, it turns out.

I, among who knows how many of the other [1 billion users](http://techcrunch.com/2016/02/01/gmail-now-has-more-than-1b-monthly-active-users/),
was sending an email to a head recruiter for a job on the following Monday (2016-04-04)
when I accidentally pressed that damn button.

Pranks violate the [cooperative principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_principle).

The next time you're going to play pranks: just don't.
Better spend your time somewhere else.
