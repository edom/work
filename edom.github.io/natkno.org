* Overview
** Target audience:
- Everyone who wants to justify physics.
- Everyone who wants to formalize physics.
** What
- Natural knowledge is knowledge about nature (reality).
- This page tries to list natural knowledge, sorted descending by verifiability.
- This page tries to teach natural knowledge in the fastest way possible.
  - Knowledge is presented top-down:
    - A child verifies its parent.
** Brief excursion to philosophy
*** Truth is a continuum (not binary true-and-false).
(Why are we saying this?)
*** Brief excursion to epistemology
- We assume that there are three sources of knowledge:
  - observation (the senses)
  - definition (fiat, agreement between speakers of the same language)
  - inference (logic, rules of thought)
*** A problem with physics: too many unjustified tacit assumptions.
- Every scientific revolution invalidates some tacit assumptions?
- Physics is mathematics + engineering + philosophy.
  - If we skip the mathematics, we can't measure.
  - If we skip the engineering, we can't experiment.
  - If we skip the philosophy, we can't progress.
    - We will make unjustified tacit assumptions.

* Matter
** Obvious things: mass, weight, volume, density
- Define: /Mass/ is the amount of matter.
  - The /mass/ of a thing is the amount of matter in that thing.
  - Tacit assumption: Things are made of a finite amount of matter.
    - Water is made of water matter.
    - Iron is made of iron matter.
    - X is made of X matter, etc.
- Define: /Weight/ is what a weight scale measures.
- Define: /Volume/ is what volume meter measures.
  - Submerge X completely into a bucket full of water.
  - The /volume/ of X is the amount of water that spills.
- Define: /Volume/ is amount of space occupied.
  - Tacit assumption: Space exists.
  - Tacit assumption: Space can be occupied.
- Define: /Density/ is mass per volume.
- Observe: Mass is not weight.
  - Jump around while measuring the weight of something.
  - The weight scale glitches.
- Assume: The mass of \( n \) copies of X is \( n \) times the mass of X.
  - Problems
    - What do we mean by a /copy/ of X? An /instance/ of X?
    - Tacit assumption: Copies of a thing are made of the same kind of matter.
    - Tacit assumption: Things of the same type behave in the same way.
  - Observe: The weight of \( n \) copies of X is \( n \) times the weight of X.
  - Assume: Weight is proportional to mass.

        - Someone focused sunlight onto leaf using natural glass, out of pure curiosity.
          - Not implausible, but isn't this less likely than accidental discovery of fire due to lightning or volcanism?

* Philosophy plans and axioms
** Plans
- /Define/ the concepts according to how we use them in everyday English.
- /Infer/ the consequences of those definitions.
- /Relate/ the concepts with each other.
- /Order/ the concepts by requirement (which concepts require which concepts).
** The axioms I assume in all my philosophical writing
- Objective reality exists.
- Logic works.
- Every statement has exactly one truth value (somewhere in the continuum between false and true), regardless of whether we know it.
** Philosophy should use everyday language.
Philosophers who bend words too much alienate themselves.
* Philosophy of mind

*** Conclusions
The /self/ of X is everything that X /controls/.

The /mind/ is what /thinks/ thoughts.

It is the /mind/ that /thinks/, not the /brain/.
*** The /mind/ is what /thinks/ thoughts.
<2018-11-04>
English suggests that /the mind is what thinks thoughts/:
It feels wrong to substitute "What's in your mind?" with "What's in your brain?".
/It is the mind that thinks, not the brain./

Brain contains brain matter.
Mind contains thoughts.

"Mind contains thoughts" implies that mind has a boundary.
*** TODO The essence of control: X /controls/ Y iff?
Example.
A feedback system /controls/ its output?
I don't /control/ what you say but I /control/ my emotion.
Who is /in control/?
The situation is getting /out of control/?
I /control/ the character's motions using this /controller/.

"Control [...] is a word with diverse meanings and applications,
ranging from those found in control theory regarding dynamical systems,
self-control of one's own behavior,
social control of processes and political mechanisms that regulate individual and group behaviour,
including security controls against perceived or unperceived dangers,
mind control,
in which groups or individuals systematically use unethically manipulative methods to direct others,
and scientific control to isolate variables in experiments." https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Control

Control is going against nature?
How can we go against nature if we are part of nature?
How can nature go against nature?

Control is making something go against what it would go when left alone.

I control something iff it does what I want.

X control Y iff Y does what X /wants/.

Control is related with want.

We assume that nature wants to enforce the law of nature?

Can nature /want/?

Can an electrical circuit /want/?

Does it make sense to say "This voltage regulator /wants/ its output voltage to be five volts"?
"A gas /wants/ to fill its container"?
"A rock /wants/ to fall"?

"The dog wants to go out for a walk"

want ~ will?

"The bomb will explode"
"The bomb wants to explode"

Control is limit.

Control is giving commands.

"To control" means "To exercise influence over; to suggest or dictate the behavior of" according to [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/control#Verb][Wiktionary]].
Thus X controls Y iff X influences Y's behavior.

What is "influence"?
*** A system's /self/ is everything that it /controls/.
**** Claim <2018-11-03>
The /self/ of X is everything that X /controls/.

Example.
A brain's self is everything that the brain controls.
My self is everything I control.
**** Supports
- The definition is /not anthropocentric/.
  It does not assume that a self belongs to a human.
- The definition /does not require consciousness/.
**** Possibly objectionable consequences
- A rich person has /more self/ than a poor person because the rich person /controls more/ things than the poor person.
- If another person B absolutely obeys all my orders, then B is a part of my self.
- An electrical circuit with feedback has a self.
**** Self-control?
The self-control of X is X's control of X?

My self-control is my control of me?

An example system with self-control is a lithium-ion battery with protection circuit?

"Self-control, an aspect of inhibitory control, is the ability to regulate one's emotions, thoughts, and behavior in the face of temptations and impulses"
according to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-control][Wikipedia]].

/Control is not always transitive./
If X controls Y, and Y controls Z, then it does not always mean X controls Z.
**** Further questions
- What is the relationship between control, intention, and causality?
**** Set-theoretic definition of self
The self of X is the /set/ of everything that X controls.
Therefore, because selves are sets, they can intersect and join.
This is an ordinary set theory in mathematics.

If there is an overlap between what A controls and what B controls,
then they /share/ that overlapping part of their selves.
That overlapping part is a /joint/ self.

The size of self may vary over time.

Selves may /merge/ and /split/.
When I'm using a computer, some of the computer's self and some of my self /merge/ into a bigger self.
When I'm not using the computer, our selves /split/.

If I sever my hand, then that hand ceases to be a part of my self, because I can no longer control it.
If I reattach it, it becomes a part of my self again, although I may not control it as well as before.
https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/5cu20w/if_your_hand_is_removed_but_reattached_in_time/
**** TODO What is the relationship between control, causality, agency, subject, and subjective experience?
**** TODO For us to determine the size of the self of a system, some its output must /feed back/ into some of its input, so that we can distinguish what it can control and what it can't.
**** TODO Our definition of "self" generalizes its dictionary meaning.
***** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self
- "The self is an individual person as the object of his or her own reflective consciousness.
  This reference is necessarily subjective, thus self is a reference by a subject to the same subject.
  The sense of having a self – or self-hood – should, however, not be confused with subjectivity itself."
- "The first-person perspective distinguishes self-hood from personal identity.
  Whereas "identity" is sameness, self-hood implies a first-person perspective."
***** Dictionary definitions of "self" assume too much.
- <2018-11-05> https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/self#Noun
  - "The subject of one's own experience of phenomena: perception, emotions, thoughts."
  - "An individual person as the object of his own reflective consciousness (plural selves)."
- <2018-11-05> https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/self
  - "A person's essential being that distinguishes them from others, especially considered as the object of introspection or reflexive action."
*** The relationship between self, mind, and brain
Consider my ANS (autonomic nervous system).

My brain controls my ANS.
My mind does not control my ANS (I don't know how).

Thus, my ANS is a part of /my brain's/ self, but my ANS is not a part of /my mind's/ self.

However, both my mind and my brain are parts of /my/ self.

My mind has only very small control over my brain.
The involuntary processes are much bigger than the voluntary processes.
**** <2018-11-06> We usually conflate /someone/ and /someone's mind/.
These questions usually mean the same thing:
- What do /you think/?
- What's /in your mind/?

That equivalence implies that your mind is a part of you or belongs to you.

However, when we insult, we say "Use your brain!", not "Use your mind!"
*** TODO Drafts
**** What does it mean to have the same thought?
"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"
**** Casual English usage
- "It has a mind of its own" means it has its own wants.
***** Expressing objections
- "Mind the gap."
- "Mind the language."
- "Do you mind if I turn on the air conditioner?"

**** Dictionary definitions of "mind"
- <2018-11-05> https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mind
  - "The element of a person that enables them to be aware of the world and their experiences, to think, and to feel; the faculty of consciousness and thought."
  - "A person's ability to think and reason; the intellect."
    - "A person's memory."

  - "The ability to remember things."
  - "The ability to focus the thoughts."
  - "Somebody that embodies certain mental qualities."
  - "Judgment, opinion, or view."
  - "Desire, inclination, or intention."
  - "A healthy mental state."
  - "(philosophy) The non-material substance or set of processes in which consciousness, perception, affectivity, judgement, thinking, and will are based."
**** <2018-11-06> Is the mind a /sense/?
- A sense connects mind and reality?
- The eye senses light.
- The ear senses sound pressure variations.
- The nose senses chemicals floating in the air.
- The mind senses thought?
**** <2018-11-04> A mind is an /organ/ that thinks?
- What is an organ?
- /Where/ is the mind?
  Does it exist in space?
**** <2018-11-04> A brain /houses/ a mind?
- Hippocrates?
  Brain is seat of mind?
**** What is the relationship between mind, sleep, and consciousness?
Does my mind exist while I'm sleeping?

My busy mind prevents me from sleeping?

Can we know anything if we don't have any senses to interact physically?

Which one sleeps: my mind, my brain, or me?
**** Volition and involition?
***** Why can't people die just by wanting to die?
***** Fucking around with language: intending to intend, wanting to want, willing to will
****** <2018-11-05> Volition is involuntary.
- Life is involuntary.
  We have life without wanting it.
- Volition is involuntary.
  We have volition without wanting it.
- We did not intend to intend?
****** All these articles are behind fucking paywalls. Who the hell pays $40 to read philosophers fuck around with language?
- 1987 article "Are Intentions Self-Referential?" https://www.jstor.org/stable/4319923?seq=1
- 2000 article "The Self-referentiality of Intentions" https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1018336525240
**** First-person view? Subjective experience? Qualia?
**** Why does subjective experience exist?
We are made of the same kinds of atoms.
Why do our consciousness differ?

Every hydrogen atom has the same property (mass, charge, etc.).

Why does subjective experience exist?
- The same functional area of different brains are located at the same spot. We can predict the effect of damaging certain areas of the brain. Thus there is a common principle that determine how all brains work.

How are our brains different, and how are our brains the same?

Compare these statements.
Which ones make sense?
- The self is everything that the brain can directly control.
- The self is everything that the brain can consciously directly control with electrical signals.
- The self is everything that the conscious mind can control.

The simplest explanation to why we don't remember our past lives is that past lives don't exist.
But human memory is unreliable.
But there are stories of some people who can corroborate their past lives?
***** Hypothesis: Adult dogs are more conscious than newborn human babies.

** Objective reality
*** My inability to manipulate everything implies the existence of reality outside my mind
What is wrong with this argument?

If my mind is all there is, then I should be omniscient and omnipotent: I should be able to do anything I want with the law of nature.

My will does not change reality.
A green elephant does not appear even though I will it to appear.
*** Is "objective reality" redundant? How does "objective reality" differ from "reality"?
*** <2018-11-06> Example difference between statements about objective reality and statements of subjective reality
There is this difference:
- "I can fly." is a statement about /objective reality/.
- "I believe I can fly." is a statement about /my subjective reality/.
*** TODO A thing is *real* iff ...
- ... it has material existence?
- ... it interacts with our senses?
- ... it influences us?
- ... we can think about it?
*** TODO We can know /some/ of objective reality.

** TODO What is /knowledge/?
*** TODO /What/ does it mean to /know/ something?
Example sentences:
- "I know the taste of salt."
- "I know you did it."
- "We know that the decimal expansion of pi begins with 3.141659..."
  - We know that pi is an irrational number.
  - We know that the decimal expansion of an irrational number doesn't end.
  - We know that we will never know all digits of pi.
  - But we know how to compute each digit of pi.
- "I know John."

*** TODO Knowledge justification dilemma
Knowledge without justification is "dumb luck": https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/384314/is-there-a-word-for-an-unjustified-true-belief

Thus, a true belief isn't always a knowledge.

Knowledge with justification suffers the Gettier problem.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem#Knowledge_as_justified_true_belief_(JTB)
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology#Defining_knowledge
*** TODO What is the difference between knowledge and belief?
**** Knowledge is a /subset/ of belief?
Every knowledge is a belief.
There are beliefs that are not knowledge.

My knowledge of the taste of salt is a belief.

Language is not necessary for belief.
For example, I can falsely believe that I have a shirt with this color that I can see in my mind but I can't describe to you.
**** Wrong: /Knowledge/ is /belief/ that agrees with /reality/.
"We know S" means "we believe S, and S is true".

When we say "S is true", we mean that S is true in objective reality.
**** Belief is not binary
"If an acquaintance suddenly contacts you after a long time of silence, he is trying to sell you insurance."

"If the cloud looks gray, it's going to rain."
**** Distinguishing the absence of belief and the belief of absence
There is a difference between "S does not believe P" and "S believes that P is false".
**** Beliefs that go against reality
False negative: S is true but I believe that S is false.

False positive: S is false but I believe that S is true.

** <2018-11-06> /Ability/ is the existence of satisfying action.
"S can P" means "There exists an action A such that, after S does A, the statement 'S did P' becomes true."

Example:
"I can boil an egg" means "There is something I can do to make the statement 'I did boil an egg' true".
*** <2018-11-06> The problem with "cannot"
There are several issues with "I can't jump 10 meters high":
- Am I not able to do that, or do I merely not know how to do that?
  There is a difference between /not being able to do/ something and /not knowing how to do/ something.
- Linguistic issue: What does "jump" mean? Must I use my own legs?
- Proving a universal negative: How do I know that there is /nothing/ I can do to make "I jumped 10 meters high" true?
** <2018-11-04> /Consciousness/ is the /ability to know/.
/Consciousness/ is the /ability to know/.

Something is /conscious/ iff it /can know/.

While I'm sleeping, I'm /unconscious/ (I have /low consciousness/), because I can only know very little while I'm sleeping.

I have /more consciousness/ when I'm awake than when I'm asleep,
because I /can know more/ when I'm awake than when I'm asleep.

Why are we so sure that a rock doesn't know anything?

On the etymology of the word "conscious",
[[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conscious][Wiktionary]]
says that it comes from Latin "con-" (together) and "scire" (to know).
*** Defining consciousness requires epistemology.
Defining consciousness as "the ability to know" raises two questions:
What does it mean to /know/ something?
What does it mean to be /able/ to do something?

"What does it mean to know something" is the question that epistemology aims to answer.

Thus defining consciousness requires epistemology.
*** How do we measure consciousness (ability to know)?
How do we measure whether X has more consciousness than Y?
*** Hypothesis: Consciousness requires sense, memory, and feedback.
- Imagine something.
- Imagine that you are imagining something.
- Imagine that the imagined you are in turn imagining something else.
  Is this even possible?
- To manipulate your consciousness,
  you must consciously intend to manipulate your consciousness.
  Can you consciously manipulate your consciousness?
- Consciousness needs sensory input.
- Consciousness needs feedback.
- Self concept needs feedback.
- If there is not a feedback, a system cannot distinguish itself from its environment.
  The self concept will never arise.
- If a brain can immediately control a thing,
  then that thing is part of the brain's self concept.
  If the brain can't, it's not.
- If a brain often gets certain input shortly after it produces certain output,
  it will associate the output with its self concept.
- The self is the thing under conscious control.
- It seems that:
  - Consciousness requires sense.
  - Consciousness requires memory.
  - Consciousness requires feedback.
- It seems that consciousness is (itself, or is caused by?)
  the feedback of information from the immediate past.
**** Memory is necessary but not sufficient for consciousness.
- If I don't have memory, I can't bunch my past self and my present self into the same identity.
**** Identity?
- Cutting off the legs of a person does not change the identity of that person.
  All of his memories are intact.
  Veterans who lost their legs in war retains their pre-war memories.
- Some brain damage changes the identity of the person.
**** Prerequisites of consciousness?
- What is /necessary/ for consciousness?
  - Thought experiment: If someone is born without any senses, it cannot be conscious?
  - Thought experiment: Of an average adult, if all motor nerves are cut, and all sensor nerves are intact,
    then he is conscious intensionally but not extensionally?
    - If we cut all efferent nerve connections,
      the person will behave the same as the one in vegetative coma.
      If we remove the prefrontal cortex,
      the person will still show vital signs, but will be vegetative.
  - Infer: Consciousness has something to do with the brain. (What is it?)
    - Observe: A brain-damaged person does not exhibit conscious behavior.
    - Assume: Philosophical zombie does not exist.
    - Assume: Trapped consciousness does not exist.

*** Neuropsychology
**** 2017 article "The Status and Future of Consciousness Research" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641373/
- This article makes me sure that
  I'm not interested in how to measure consciousness,
  I'm not interested in neural correlates of consciousness,
  and I'm not interested in neuroscience.
- Consciousness research is multidisciplinary.
  - "Cognitive scientists and neuroscientists agreed that the philosophical problems of why and how there is consciousness are also their problems.
    Philosophers agreed that empirical evidence may resolve or at least influence this debate.
    Scientists across disciplines generally agree that consciousness is subjective, characterized by a kind of privileged first-person access."
- Challenges
  - "One major obstacle for consciousness research is the lacking consensus of how to optimally measure consciousness empirically."
  - "Another major challenge is how to identify neural correlates of consciousness."
- "The future challenges"
  - "One major future challenge will be how to measure consciousness 'from the outside'."
  - "One possibly even greater challenge will be to reintegrate the philosophical metaphysical debate into the scientific work."
- "Future directions"
  - "Currently, consciousness research is often considered a 'topic'—or even 'niche'—under the umbrella of cognitive neuroscience."
**** 2011 article "Understanding Brain, Mind and Soul: Contributions from Neurology and Neurosurgery" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3115284/
- The section "The Mind" correlates brain damage and behavior change.
- The section "Where is the Mind Located?" says "The brain is the organ of the mind just as the lungs are the organs for respiration."
- "How does the Mind Function?"
  - "Krishnamoorthy (2009) uses an analogy based on computers to explain the workings of the mind: [...]"
  - "The mind cannot be localised to particular areas within the brain, [...]"
- "The Soul"; "The search and some conclusions"
  - "In 1907, Dr. Duncan MacDougall of Haverhill, Massachusetts, decided to weigh the soul by weighing a human being in the act of death."
  - "If there be a soul, where is it located? Views of neuroscientists"
    - "If we accept the existence of the soul and its localisation in the brain, we must focus on the brainstem."
- "Take home message"
  - "The study of the brain, mind and soul has engaged some of the finest intellects of yesteryears.
    It remains an ennobling and inspiring pursuit, worthy of all those who are dedicated votaries of science."
- "Questions That This Paper Raises"
  - "2. Do you agree with the author’s conclusions on the mind in the brain?"
    - My objections to the article
      - <2018-11-04>
        I doubt "The brain is the organ of the mind [...]";
        near-death experience research suggests that the mind can function without brain activity.
*** Popular science

- "In coming years, neuroscience will answer questions we don't even yet know to ask.
  Sometimes, though, focus on the brain is misleading."
- Neurocentric/reductionistic/materialistic approach to addiction theory, that focuses on the brain but ignores the mind, is wrong.
**** 2013 article "Why are top scientists [...] interested in researching human consciousness?" https://www.mindscience.org/index.php/research/the-scientific-study-of-consciousness.html
- "modern brain imaging seems to indicate that it is Spinoza's concept of an integrated mind-body that is closer to reality."
- "psychologist William James' great work on consciousness in the late 1800s is slowly regaining the pivotal position it deserves in understanding and interpreting human behavior."
- "technological advances in brain imaging have given scientists a new range of tools to more accurately observe and measure the apparent causes and manifestations of consciousness."
*** Nonlocality

- Epistemology

  - There are two kinds of knowledge: /prior/ and /posterior/.

    - Prior (before-the-fact) knowledge is obtained by inferring theorems from axioms through the rules of logic.
    - Posterior (after-the-fact) knowledge is obtained by observation from the real world through the physical senses.

- How do we reboot human knowledge from zero?

  - There are some ways in which everything might be destroyed:

    - the next world war
    - the next big space object impact

  - We must survive.

    - Find, gather, and follow the survivalists.

      - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivalism][WP:Survivalism]]

    - We must drink.

      - Settle near a clean river.

- Does fasting help someone heal from a disease?

  - Hypothesis: it might help healing because when you not don't eat, your body's immune system can focus on fighting the disease.
  - Hypothesis: it might worsen the disease because your body doesn't get enough nutrient to fight the disease.
  - Hypothesis: it might have no effect.

* Physics
- In the 21st century

  - Every branch of physics is about constructing a mathematical model of nature.

    - Every branch is interested in different aspects of nature.

      - Example: Mechanics is interested in motion.

- Physics can't be separated from philosophy, mathematics, and engineering?
- Philosophy of physics

  - The epistemology (how-do-we-know) of physics is the scientific method.

    - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method][WP:Scientific method]]
    - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetico-deductive_model][WP:Hypothetico-deductive model]]
    - If theory and experiment disagree, experiment wins.

      - Unless the experiment is faulty.

    - Are there alternatives?

  - The ontology?

    - Something is defined by its properties?
    - Something is defined by its behaviors (relation to others)?

- Ontology

  - an attempt

    - undefined terms

      - touch

    - A /matter/ is something we can touch.

      - The air is also a matter because we can feel it with our sense of touch.

          - Should "matter" be undefined?

            - Is physics about explaining our perceptions?

      - A matter is something that exists?

        - But how do we know that it exists if not from our senses?

                - Do we have to?

                  - Yes?

                    - Who claims, proves.

                      - If you claim that someone raped you, you have to prove it.
                      - Problem?

                        - If you claim that someone has /never/ raped you, you have to prove it.

                          - But how?

                            - Let there be three people X, Y, Z.
                            - Z (probably a judge in a court) doesn't know either X or Y.
                            - How does X prove, to Z, that Y has never raped X?

                              - There are things that are true but unprovable?

                                - Is God true but unprovable (if there is a coherent definition of "God")?

                          - This can be used as a joke?

                            - X: "Hey, do you know? Y has never raped me, but I can't prove it."
                            - Z: "So, what are you suggesting?"

                        - How do we prove that Y has never transferred anything to X's bank account?

                          - We assume that the bank is honest and maintains correct records.

                            - Why should Z accept this assumption?

                              - Should Z still accept this assumption if X owned the bank?

                          - The bank record is finite.
                          - Then we only need to check exhaustively whether there is anything from Y in the records.

                        - How do we prove that there isn't a teapot orbiting the sun?

                          - We can't visit every point in space.
                          - We can't exhaustive-check the entire Universe.
                          - We can't.
                          - But we can say that it's /implausible/.

                            - Why? How?
                            - What if there is really a teapot-shaped space rock orbiting the sun?

                        - How do you prove that two people have never met before?
                        - How to prove libel?

                          - Suppose:

                            - X did rape Y.
                            - Y claims that X raped Y, but can't prove it.

                          - Then can X countersue Y with libel?

                      - If you claim that God exists, you have to prove it.
                      - If you claim that God doesn't exist, you also have to prove it.
                      - If you don't claim that God exists or not, then you don't have to prove anything.
                      - If you /believe/ something, then you don't have to prove anything to others,
                        as long as you don't claim it before them.

                        - Our belief is a claim we make before ourselves.
                          If we can prove it, good for us.
                          If we can't prove it, it's our problem.
                        - But, spreading a belief is making a claim before others.
                          It has to be proven.

* Fixing reification fallacies; we often conflate a representation of a thing and the thing itself.

https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mistaking_the_map_for_the_territory

Light is neither particle nor wave. Light may /behave/ like particle. Light may behave like wave. It is categorically impossible for something to be both a particle and a wave.

A picture of a duck is not a duck. But we often conflate them. The picture /depicts/ a duck. The picture is not a duck.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images

This is rampant in mathematics.
For example, which are the natural numbers: 0,1,2; or z,sz,ssz?
Neither.
Those are only representations of natural numbers. The essence of natural numbers is /succession/:
- There exists exactly one natural number that is not the successor of any other natural numbers.
- The successor of a natural number is another natural number.
But it is shorter to say "Let 0 /be/ a natural number" than "Let 0 /represent/ a natural number", and the writer actually means the latter while writing the former, and the reader implicitly understands that.

Is a function a tuple, or does the tuple represent the function?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(fallacy)

- The representation is not the thing.
- The model is not the reality.
- The map is not the territory.
- The ceremony is not the faith.
- The uniform is not the power.
- The money is not the wealth.
- The manliness is not the man.
- The marriage is not the relationship.
- The speech is not the thought.
- The publication is not the science.
- The school is not the education.

What?

- "Ontology of Mathematics" https://philpapers.org/browse/ontology-of-mathematics
  - "A good introductory survey is Horsten 2008. A readable introduction to philosophy of mathematics is Shapiro 2000. A nice, albeit somewhat biased survey of ontological options can be found in the first few chapters of Chihara 1990. A very nice introduction to the development of foundations of mathematics and the interaction between foundations, epistemology and ontology of mathematics is Giaquinto 2002."
