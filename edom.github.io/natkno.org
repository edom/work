* Overview
** Target audience:
- Everyone who wants to justify physics.
- Everyone who wants to formalize physics.
** What
- Natural knowledge is knowledge about nature (reality).
- This page tries to list natural knowledge, sorted descending by verifiability.
- This page tries to teach natural knowledge in the fastest way possible.
  - Knowledge is presented top-down:
    - A child verifies its parent.
* Brief excursion to philosophy
** Truth is a continuum (not binary true-and-false).
(Why are we saying this?)
** Brief excursion to epistemology
- We assume that there are three sources of knowledge:
  - observation (the senses)
  - definition (fiat, agreement between speakers of the same language)
  - inference (logic, rules of thought)
** A problem with physics: too many unjustified tacit assumptions.
- Every scientific revolution invalidates some tacit assumptions?
- Physics is mathematics + engineering + philosophy.
  - If we skip the mathematics, we can't measure.
  - If we skip the engineering, we can't experiment.
  - If we skip the philosophy, we can't progress.
    - We will make unjustified tacit assumptions.

* Matter
** Obvious things: mass, weight, volume, density
- Define: /Mass/ is the amount of matter.
  - The /mass/ of a thing is the amount of matter in that thing.
  - Tacit assumption: Things are made of a finite amount of matter.
    - Water is made of water matter.
    - Iron is made of iron matter.
    - X is made of X matter, etc.
- Define: /Weight/ is what a weight scale measures.
- Define: /Volume/ is what volume meter measures.
  - Submerge X completely into a bucket full of water.
  - The /volume/ of X is the amount of water that spills.
- Define: /Volume/ is amount of space occupied.
  - Tacit assumption: Space exists.
  - Tacit assumption: Space can be occupied.
- Define: /Density/ is mass per volume.
- Observe: Mass is not weight.
  - Jump around while measuring the weight of something.
  - The weight scale glitches.
- Assume: The mass of \( n \) copies of X is \( n \) times the mass of X.
  - Problems
    - What do we mean by a /copy/ of X? An /instance/ of X?
    - Tacit assumption: Copies of a thing are made of the same kind of matter.
    - Tacit assumption: Things of the same type behave in the same way.
  - Observe: The weight of \( n \) copies of X is \( n \) times the weight of X.
  - Assume: Weight is proportional to mass.

        - Someone focused sunlight onto leaf using natural glass, out of pure curiosity.
          - Not implausible, but isn't this less likely than accidental discovery of fire due to lightning or volcanism?

                - "some metals gained mass when they burned, even though they were supposed to have lost phlogiston."
              - Replaced by Lavoisier's oxygen theory in the 1780s

          - If burning \( x \) amount of wood produces \( y \) amount grams of ash,
            then burning \( a \cdot x \) amount grams of wood produces \( a \cdot y \) amount of ash.

* Mind
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness][WP:Consciousness]]
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind][WP:Mind]]
- What is the state of the art? What is current research?
- Intension (actual) vs extension (apparent)
  - Intension: actually having a mind
  - Extension: apparently having a mind (behaving like something having a mind)
  - We are interested in the intension.
  - Is it even possible to test the intension?
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness][WP:Hard problem of consciousness]]
    - intension is "hard" problem
    - extension is "easy" problem
  - Examples of consciousness:
    - Intensional but not extensional: a person playing dead.
    - Extensional but not intensionally: a rule-based system with very many rules
      but never changes (doesn't have memory, doesn't learn).
      - Why isn't it intensionally conscious? It displays complex behavior.
        - Also, for every test it fails, we can always add a rule.
        - We can also add rules to make it behave as if it were self-aware.

      then he is conscious intensionally but not extensionally?
      - If we cut all efferent nerve connections,
        the person will behave the same as the one in vegetative coma.
        If we remove the prefrontal cortex,
        the person will still show vital signs, but will be vegetative.

  - Imagine something.
  - Imagine that you are imagining something.
  - Imagine that the imagined you are in turn imagining something else.
    Is this even possible?
  - To manipulate your consciousness,
    you must consciously intend to manipulate your consciousness.
    Can you consciously manipulate your consciousness?
  - Consciousness needs sensory input.
  - Consciousness needs feedback.
  - Self concept needs feedback.
  - If there is not a feedback, a system cannot distinguish itself from its environment.
    The self concept will never arise.
  - If a brain can immediately control a thing,
    then that thing is part of the brain's self concept.
    If the brain can't, it's not.
  - If a brain often gets certain input shortly after it produces certain output,
    it will associate the output with its self concept.
  - The self is the thing under conscious control.
  - It seems that:
    - Consciousness requires sense.
    - Consciousness requires memory.
    - Consciousness requires feedback.
  - It seems that consciousness is (itself, or is caused by?)
    the feedback of information from the immediate past.
  - Observe: I move my hand, and I see my hand move,
    therefore I infer that I can control my hand,
    and therefore I infer that my hand is part of my self.
  - My /self/ is /everything/ I can control.
  - If another person B absolutely obeys my orders, then is B a part of my self?
    - I can't feel what B feel.
  - I know the extent of my self by experimenting.
    I find out what I can control and what I can't.
    The part I can control, I call my /self/.
  - The self of A is everything that A can directly control.
    If A is driving a car, the car becomes part of A's self, until he stops driving.

* Let's go back to prehistoric times.
- Let's begin with very wrong ideas.
  - We're "cheating": we have hindsight; they didn't.
- We will revise knowledge as we go. We will become less wrong.
- We might will never be 0% wrong.
  - But knowledge doesn't have to be 100% true in order to be useful.

- Some branches of philosophy

  - Epistemology (how do we know?)
  - Ontology (what exists?)
  - Ethics (morality; what should be?)

- Epistemology

  - There are two kinds of knowledge: /prior/ and /posterior/.

    - Prior (before-the-fact) knowledge is obtained by inferring theorems from axioms through the rules of logic.
    - Posterior (after-the-fact) knowledge is obtained by observation from the real world through the physical senses.
