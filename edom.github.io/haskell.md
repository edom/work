- Setting up development environment
    - Duplicate intersecting efforts?
    Too many choices?
        - Why is there Haskell Platform and Haskell Stack?
        - Which should we use?
        - Why is there haskell-lang.org and haskell.org?
            - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12054690
        - Why should I use Platform if there is Stack?
        - Why should I use Stack if there is Cabal new-style?
        - Why Stack?
            - Vetted packages?
        - http://www.haskellforall.com/2018/05/how-i-evaluate-haskell-packages.html
    - Install the Haskell `stack` tool.
        - I use the [manual download](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/#linux).
            - If you want to make sure that the download isn't corrupted, check the corresponding sha256sum from [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/).
            - If you don't mind sudoing, use the installer script in the [documentation](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).
        - Then I check the archive contents using `tar tzf`.
        - If there's no weird paths, I extract the archive with `tar xzf`.
        - Then I make the symbolic link `~/.local/bin/stack`.
        - If you use the manual download, you may have to install some operating system packages.
            - The list is on the [install script](https://get.haskellstack.org/).
            Search for `install_dependencies` for your distro.
    - Choose a Stack solver.
        - Forget it. Just install GHC to home.
            - `./configure --prefix ~/.local`
            - `make -j4 install`
    - Which version of GHC should I use?
            - The one that is supported by
            [HaRe](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HaRe) (Haskell refactoring tool) and
            [Leksah](https://github.com/leksah/leksah).
                - On 2018-08-20, this is 8.0.2.
                    - Leksah requires ghc >= 8.0.2.
                    - HaRe supports ghc <= 8.0.2.
                    - GHC 8.0 is unacceptably slow.
                        - Forget HaRe. We'll go with Leksah. Use GHC 8.4.3.
        - The widely supported GHC version lags very much behind the latest stable GHC version.
        I think this may be because the GHC team is rolling out lots of breaking changes in the parser because they are working on the "Trees that grow" proposal.
        - Which Stackage LTS version should I use?
            - [LTS 6.35](https://www.stackage.org/lts-6.35) if GHC 7.10.3?
                - It also hosts a hoogle search for searching Haskell program elements.

                        - He got tired of working alone.
                        He pointed us to [FPComplete ide-backend](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2015/03/announce-ide-backend).
                            - [ide-backend](https://github.com/fpco/ide-backend) seems dead; last activity is in 2016.

    - Module system
    - `Read(read)` should be renamed to `CoShow(coshow)`.
- How to get started?
    - Too many choices
        - install using the package manager that comes with your system
            - pros: least hassle
            - cons: outdated software
        - Stack
        - Cabal
        - Nix
        - Haskell Platform
- What is your preferred way of installing Haskell?
    - Install `cabal-install`
        - Download the suitable `cabal-install` binary package from https://www.haskell.org/cabal/download.html
        - Extract the `cabal` binary to `~/.local/bin`
    - Install current stable release of GHC
        - Download the current stable release of GHC from https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html
        - Extract it somewhere
        - Follow the instructions in INSTALL file:
            - `./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local`
            - `make -j4 install`
    - Modify `PATH` in `~/.basrhc`:
        - Ensure that the line `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"` is in `~/.bashrc`.
    - For what is the hassle?
        - So that, if anything goes wrong, I can nuke it without nuking my whole operating system.

- The alternative to Cabal PVP is compile error, or, even worse, logic error and runtime failure?
    - Cabal PVP depends on library authors/maintainers to test and update their dependency bounds.
    - It's not only Haskell, but all programming.
    Every library author must thoughtfully maintain backward compatibility and can't just make arbitrary changes and break things.
