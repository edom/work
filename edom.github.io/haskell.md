    - Which version of GHC should I use?
        - The one that is supported by HaRe (Haskell refactoring tool) and other tools (IDE, Leksah, Cabal, etc.).
        In 2018, I think the safe choice is GHC 7.10?

            - Does Cabal 2.2 work with GHC 7.10?

    - Module system
- How to get started?
    - Too many choices
        - install using the package manager that comes with your system
            - pros: least hassle
            - cons: outdated software
        - Stack
        - Cabal
        - Nix
        - Haskell Platform
- What is your preferred way of installing Haskell?
    - Install `cabal-install`
        - Download the suitable `cabal-install` binary package from https://www.haskell.org/cabal/download.html
        - Extract the `cabal` binary to `~/.local/bin`
    - Install current stable release of GHC
        - Download the current stable release of GHC from https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html
        - Extract it somewhere
        - Follow the instructions in INSTALL file:
            - `./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local`
            - `make -j4 install`
    - Modify `PATH` in `~/.basrhc`:
        - Ensure that the line `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"` is in `~/.bashrc`.
    - For what is the hassle?
        - So that, if anything goes wrong, I can nuke it without nuking my whole operating system.
