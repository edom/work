- How to get started?
    - Too many choices
        - install using the package manager that comes with your system
            - pros: least hassle
            - cons: outdated software
        - Stack
        - Cabal
        - Nix
        - Haskell Platform
- What is your preferred way of installing Haskell?
    - Download `cabal-install` binary from https://www.haskell.org/cabal/download.html
    - Download GHC
    - Extract the `cabal` binary to `~/.local/bin`
    - Extract the `ghc` binary to `~/.local/bin`
    - Modify `PATH` in `~/.basrhc`
    - For what is the hassle?
        - So that, if anything goes wrong, I can nuke it without nuking my whole operating system.
