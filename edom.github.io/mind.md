- What is the state of the art? What is current research?
- Intension (actual) vs extension (apparent)
    - Intension: actually having a mind
    - Extension: apparently having a mind (behaving like something having a mind)
    - We are interested in the intension.
    - Is it even possible to test the intension?
    - [WP:Hard problem of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness)
        - intension is "hard" problem
        - extension is "easy" problem
    - Examples of consciousness:
        - Intensional but not extensional: a person playing dead.
        - Extensional but not intensionally: a rule-based system with very many rules
        but never changes (doesn't have memory, doesn't learn).
            - Why isn't it intensionally conscious? It displays complex behavior.
                - Also, for every test it fails, we can always add a rule.
                - We can also add rules to make it behave as if it were self-aware.

    - Extension: A system is a *reflex* system iff its reaction is always the same.

    - What questions should we ask?
- Prerequisites of consciousness
    - What is *necessary* for consciousness?
        - Thought experiment: If someone is born without any senses, it cannot be conscious?
        - Thought experiment: Of an average adult, if all motor nerves are cut, and all sensor nerves are intact,
        then he is conscious intensionally but not extensionally?
            - If we cut all efferent nerve connections,
            the person will behave the same as the one in vegetative coma.
            If we remove the prefrontal cortex,
            the person will still show vital signs, but will be vegetative.
        - Infer: Consciousness has something to do with the brain. (What is it?)
            - Observe: A brain-damaged person does not exhibit conscious behavior.
            - Assume: Philosophical zombie does not exist.
            - Assume: Trapped consciousness does not exist.

        - Assume: There is no experiment that can decide between these two things:
        the absence of consciousness, and the absence of efferent nerves?
        - Assume: My consciousness is tied to my body.
        - Assume: When I sleep, my consciousness pauses.

        - Assume: There was a time after I was born but before I became conscious.
        - Assume: There isn't any point in time when I suddenly become conscious.

                - 15-month-old babies might fail the test.
    - How do we measure consciousness?
        - Extensional measurement
            - [WP:Glasgow Coma Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Coma_Scale)?
            - [abiroh.com](http://www.abiroh.com/en/what-science-has-forgotten/196.html):
            detect consciousness by anomaly in the output of a hardware random number generator
            - Extensional measurement is unsatisfactory. It doesn't explain how consciousness works.
        - Intensional measurement?

- Are there scientific experiments?

    - Imagine something.
    - Imagine that you are imagining something.
    - Imagine that the imagined you are in turn imagining something else.
    Is this even possible?
    - To manipulate your consciousness,
    you must consciously intend to manipulate your consciousness.
    Can you consciously manipulate your consciousness?
    - Consciousness needs sensory input.
    - Consciousness needs feedback.
    - Self concept needs feedback.
    - If there is not a feedback, a system cannot distinguish itself from its environment.
    The self concept will never arise.
    - If a brain can immediately control a thing,
    then that thing is part of the brain's self concept.
    If the brain can't, it's not.
    - If a brain often gets certain input shortly after it produces certain output,
    it will associate the output with its self concept.
    - The self is the thing under conscious control.
    - It seems that:
        - Consciousness requires sense.
        - Consciousness requires memory.
        - Consciousness requires feedback.
    - It seems that consciousness is (itself, or is caused by?)
    the feedback of information from the immediate past.
    - Observe: I move my hand, and I see my hand move,
    therefore I infer that I can control my hand,
    and therefore I infer that my hand is part of my self.
    - My *self* is *everything* I can control.
    - If another person B absolutely obeys my orders, then is B a part of my self?
        - I can't feel what B feel.
    - I know the extent of my self by experimenting.
    I find out what I can control and what I can't.
    The part I can control, I call my *self*.
    - The self of A is everything that A can directly control.
    If A is driving a car, the car becomes part of A's self, until he stops driving.
