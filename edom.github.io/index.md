## Welcome and disclaimers

I write everything for myself, but I hope you find it useful.

I may err.
Read cautiously.
Compare with other independent sources.

I am not responsible for other people's comments.

Organization of this site:
For most pages, the title is a goal, and the content is the ongoing journey to achieve it.
