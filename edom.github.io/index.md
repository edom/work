                - Use credit card, not debit card.
            - Use credit card, but don't fall into debt.
            Treat credit card as means of payment, not loan.
            - Never use debit card outside trusted ATMs.
            - But what about cash withdrawals from ATMs?
            Credit cards have higher fees.
