            - Important and urgent things for most (if not all) countries on Earth to do as soon as possible:
                - Legislators, please change the justice system from retributive justice to restorative justice, at least for the non-violent criminals.
                    - Instead of locking up prisoners, let them repair the harm they did.
                    - Millions of people are being incarcerated.
                    Their ability is being wasted.
                    They are deprived of future.
                    They will have difficulties reintegrating into society.
                    Stigmatized.
                    Like the homeless.
                    This stigma makes it impossible for them to get financial stability and get out of the vicious circle of crime.
