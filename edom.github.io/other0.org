This file is for my capture-refile workflow.
* <2018-09-11> Microeconomics
An economy consists of actors.

- No economic actor has complete view of the economy.
  Every actor can only see his suppliers and consumers.
- Every actor responds only to what immediately affects it: its direct suppliers and consumers.
- Actors need time to respond to change in demand/supply.
- Some actors maintain buffers/inventories.
- Some actors get involved in futures.

Hypotheses:

- Shocks ripple through actors.
- Demand collapse may waste inventory.

Statistics can give us an accurate picture of the economy.
Random sampling of actors.
* TODO <2018-09-15> Fix possible programming error in ~/work/web in Iterables.filter
* TODO <2018-09-15> Modernize operating system
Back up data.
Should not take more than a day.
** TODO <2018-09-15> Install Ubuntu 18.04 after its point release
Ubuntu 14.04 EOL is April 2019.
* TODO <2018-09-15> Make an Emacs Lisp interpreter in Haskell for Yi editor
* Rencana legislasi; some are probably bad ideas
** <2018-09-17> Gratiskan kendaraan umum bertrayek
- Lebih mudah dan murah daripada integrasi antarmoda?
- Mengurangi trafik dan polusi.
*** Biaya yang diperlukan (unit economics)
- Gaji supir 20 jam/minggu Rp 5 juta/bulan
- Bahan bakar, 5 km/liter, Rp 10000/liter
- Biaya perawatan kendaraan Rp ?/bulan
- Kecepatan rata-rata 50 km/jam
- Asuransi kesehatan Rp ?/bulan
- Asuransi kendaraan Rp ?/bulan
*** Potensi masalah dan penolakan
**** Pengemudi ojek, taksi, dan mobil sewa mungkin menolak karena pendapatan mereka mungkin berkurang
- Bantu mereka beralih jadi supir kendaraan umum bertrayek.
*** Negara lain yang sudah berhasil
** Fix the system; berantas perverse incentive, principal-agent problem, dan conflict of interest
*** <2018-09-17> Larang partai membayar anggota; wajibkan anggota membayar partai?
- Berantas politik karir.
- Pastikan bahwa yang masuk adalah orang yang benar-benar peduli politik.
- Tapi kalau begini, politik jadi sampingan.
  Tidak semua orang mau punya 2 pekerjaan.
* Obtain political power?
** TODO <2018-09-17> Join a think tank or a political party or both?
** TODO <2018-09-17> Educate the people about critical thinking, religion, history, power, and politics?
* <2018-09-17> Open source Heroku/PaaS/dashboard alternative?
We don't even know what such things are called.

Google search "open source heroku clone".

As usual, there are too many open source options.

- From [[https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-open-source-Heroku-alternatives][What are some open source Heroku alternatives? - Quora]]:
  Dokku, Flynn, Convox?, Globo.com Tsuru, Apache Stratos, cloudify-cosmo, lastbackend, CaptainDuckDuck.
* TODO Ask others
** Who should we ask?
- Haskell Cafe mailing list
- #haskell on freenode IRC
- Haskell reddit
- Abdullah
** TODO <2018-09-17> Is there anything like Pandoc but for programming languages instead of markup languages?
Does anyone know of anything like Pandoc but for programming languages?

For example, it would translate Haskell to Java by translating Haskell into an internal representation and then translating that internal representation to Java.

Possible related things:
- LLVM IR
- GHC Core
* Setting up and running a X.509 certificate authority (for TLS, for example)
Practically everyone uses OpenSSL.

What servers do we have to setup?
OCSP responder?
** What software are other certificate authorities using?
** Guides of varying qualities other have written

* Hiring, interviewing, recruiting
** Hiring standards, what to test in work sample tests
*** IOT engineer
Must master some of hardware, software, and business.

- Software
  - C++ smart pointers
- Hardware
  - soldering skills
  - basic understanding of electric circuits
  - designing and making PCBs, including local knowledge of where to buy components and services

What the employer may expect the employee to do:

- design and make systems (hardware and software) with constrained production cost and field operation
- maintain existing programs written in C++/Java (or whatever the employer uses), including documenting software
- travel to maintain remote hardware
** What is the best predictor?
According to [[http://blog.eskill.com/best-worst-predictors/][eskill.com]]:
- past behavior
- conscientiousness (what is this? how do we test this?)
- cognitive ability

Interviews must be structured.
Unstructured interviews waste time.

[[https://resources.workable.com/blog/conduct-structured-interview][How to conduct a structured interview | Workable]]

We can test skill.

How do we test behavior?

Questions are unreliable.
Actions are reliable.

Where is the research paper?

How does Google hire?

What is the best predictor of on-the-job performance?
How do we interview to best predict on-the-job/post-interview performance?
- work sample test
- education/university
- IQ
- github
- tricky questions
- school grades
- what else?

Is there evidence-based hiring like evidence-based medicine?

Can we use machine learning to hire people?
