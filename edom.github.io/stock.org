* How does stock prices move?
- The market makers have new information and reaches a new consensus?
- Someone is throwing a huge amount of money?
* No-arbitrage constraint for stock prices
Valuation: no-arbitrage principle for stocks, liquidation value, plus the time-discounted dividends

because otherwise someone with enough money can buy enough shares and liquidate the firm for a /risk-free profit/.
