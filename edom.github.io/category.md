- What is the history of category theory? Who invented it? Why?
    - [Quora: How did topology motivate the creation of category theory?](https://www.quora.com/How-did-topology-motivate-the-creation-of-category-theory?share=1)
- What is a graph?
    - A graph has *vertices* and *edges*.
- What is an undirected graph? What is a directed graph?
    - A *undirected* graph is a graph whose edges are *unordered* pairs.
    - A *directed* graph is a graph whose edges are *ordered* pairs.
- Which one is the default?
    - In this document, when we say just "graph", we mean "directed graph".
- What is a pre-category?
- What is a category?
    - A category has *objects* and *morphisms*, and satisfies the category axioms.
        - What is an object?
            - Anything. It's undefined, like "point" in geometry.
        - What is a morphism?
        - What are the category axioms?
    - A category can be thought as a graph whose edge relation is reflexive and transitive.
- What is a functor?
    - A functor maps a category to another category.
    - The endofunctors on a category \\( C \\) form a category called the *functor category* of \\( C \\).
        - Category theory is recursive.
- What is a natural transformation?
- What is an adjunction?
- What is a monad?
    - A monad is a triple \\( (T,\mu,\eta) \\).
