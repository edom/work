# JetBrains MPS

MPS is "Meta Programming System".

A concept can have properties. Each property has a type.
The property type system is limited to int, string, and regex-constrained string.

A member in a model is an *instance* of a concept,
similar to how an object is an instance of a class in Java.

MPS is a *tree* editor, not a text editor.

A concept is an AST (abstract syntax tree) node type.

On 2017-08-12, MPS 2017.2 doesn't support Java 7 try-with-resources statements.

The MPS IntelliJ IDEA plugin allows you to use a language from IDEA,
but not defining your own language.
You need the MPS IDE for that.
