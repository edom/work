- A program is a big lambda expression. Why do we need modules?
- How do we organize programs?
    - The smallest unit for this discussion is a machine instruction.
    - A subroutine is a collection of instructions.
    - A library is a collection of subroutines.
    - A program is a collection of libraries and an entry point.
    - History
        - The initial motivation was to reuse.
            - Reduce development cost.
        - The next motivation was to reduce disk and memory usage.
    - The essence of programming-in-the-large is Don't Repeat Yourself?
- What is a module?
    - "What is a module?" = "How do we decompose a program?"
    - What do others say?
        - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module)
        - [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/module)
        - [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/module)
    - What are the properties of a module?
    - What are its relationships with other things?
        - interchangeability
    - A module groups things.
        - Is this essential or accidental?
        Is it made for grouping?
        Is grouping only a side-effect?
    - What can we do with modules?
        - We can combine modules.
        - We can shadow modules.
        - We can link modules.
        - We can embed/inline modules.
    - A module is an incomplete/dependent piece of functionality/code.
        - A module may have unresolved symbols?
    - A module is a decomposition of a program?
    - Module is about reusability?
    - A program is a module and a starting point.
    - A module specifies a contract.
    A module can be swapped with another module that satisfies the same contract without changing the correctness of the program.
    - A module is a bunch of imports and exports?
    - A module is smallest unit of reuse? Isn't that function?
    - A module is smallest unit of compilation? Isn't that function?
- Module is second-order logic programming?
Note below, that the same `Plus` is used as both a variable and a predicate.

```
export(module_name, type, name, value).

export(prelude, int, plus, Plus) |- export(my_module, int, three, Plus(1, 2)).
```

- Who uses module?
Human and computer.
    - Human uses modules for organizing things.
    - Computer uses modules to separate compilation, to speed up recompilation, to enable partial recompilation.
- Does a module have to coincide with a compilation unit?
- How do other languages deal with modules?

- Basic module functions?
    - How does a code describe its dependencies?
    - How does the machine disambiguate names?
    - Functions should be versioned. Not module. Not package.
    Version describes semantics.
- Key idea: A module is just a lambda abstraction that returns a record (tuple whose components are named), in a dependently-typed language.
    - Module = lambda-calculus + dictionary
    - This idea is similar to Nix and JavaScript modules.
    - `type Module = Map Name Decl -> Map Name Decl`
    - A module translates into a lambda-calculus expression.
    - An import translates to an entry in the input kvm.
        - kvm = key-value map, look-up table, dictionary
    - An export translates to an entry in the output kvm.
    - Example:

    ```
    module {
        import add mul Int32;
        export f g T;
        f = add;
        g = mul;
        T = Int32;
    };

    -- The expression above translates to:

    \ {add; mul; Int32; ...} -> {
        f = add;
        g = mul;
        T = Int32;
    };
    ```

    - Key ideas of that example:
        - Dictionary pattern matching simulates row polymorphism.
        - `{a;b;c;}` is shorthand for `{a:a; b:b; c:c;}`.

    - Ecosystem, libraries, tools, and communities.
    - The most important thing in programming in the large is name management.
    Namespaces.
        - C has two namespaces: type namespace and value namespace.
        - Haskell has two namespaces: type namespace and value namespace.
        - Java has better namespacing than C.
        - Enable the same name to be used in different context, so that you can write `get_name employee` and `get_name company` instead of `employee_get_name employee` or `company_get_name company`.

        - Things that annoy me
            - ML, SML, Caml, OCaml: `'a tf` is somewhat annoying. It should have been `tf a`.
                - F# uses `tf<'a>`.
                - Haskell uses `Tf a`.
            - Would you rather type `'a list` (F#) or deal with an inadequate record/module system (Haskell)?
            - Haskell doesn't have `instance Read (->)` and `instance Show (->)`.
                - Haskell expressions are not first-class citizen in the language.
                    - Unlike Lisp/Scheme.
                - Encumbers metaprogramming.
        - OCaml labels and polymorphic variants?
            - http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-400/manual006.html
            - OCaml labels are somewhat similar to Scheme keyword arguments.
        - F# quotations is important for metaprogramming.
        - F# doesn't do ad-hoc polymorphism well?

            - Jon Harrop claims. More sources needed. Take it with a grain of salt.
                - "OCaml has an integrated full-blown macro system in the form of Camlp4 whereas F# does not have macros and, in fact, has been deliberately closed off in order to discourage people from creating products that compete with Visual Studio."
                    - "deliberately closed off [...]" is a bold claim.
