- Is counterfactual reasoning valid?
    - How does it differ from wishful thinking?
- How do we justify counterfactual reasoning?
    - How do we justify statements like "If Hitler had never been made a Chancellor, then World War 2 would have never happened."?
        - If Hitler hadn't done it, wouldn't someone else have?
        - If Hitler hadn't done it, wouldn't there be someone else more evil?
- Tacit assumptions
    - [WP:Tacit assumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_assumption)
    - When reasoning counterfactually, we tacitly assume:
        - The law of nature doesn't change.
            - The law of nature is the same 1,000 years ago.
                - It seems that any attempt at justifying this would crash into Hume's induction problem.
                    - The law of nature is the same yesterday.
                    - The law of nature is the same two days ago.
                    - The law of nature has always been the same?
                        - We don't know the law of nature before the Big Bang.
                    - However, for most practical purposes, the law of nature has always been the same.
