- Where can I find more information?
    - [Wikipedia: Academic journal publishing reform](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal_publishing_reform)
    - Where can I find more information about the current state and recent progress?
        - [Timothy Gowers's blog, "Elsevier" category](https://gowers.wordpress.com/category/elsevier/)

- What is it?
    - a battle between many oppressed academics and some questionable publishing companies
- Who are the heros?
    - Aaron Swartz, who is a hero to the researchers in poor countries, and a criminal to the prosecutors
    - Timothy Gowers, who began a boycott against Elsevier
    - and other tens of thousands of academics who care, probably more
    - I don't know. There have to be other people. They don't work alone.
- Who are the villains?
    - mainly Elsevier, because of two reasons:
        - It's the biggest academic publisher.
        - It does [lots of questionable things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier#Criticism_and_controversies).
        - [Tal Yarkoni's comprehensive argument against Elsevier](https://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2016/12/12/why-i-still-wont-review-for-or-publish-with-elsevier-and-think-you-shouldnt-either/)
    - and some other predatory publishers
- What are the problems?
    - Price gouging, done rationally by a profit-seeking monopoly.
    See also the list of questionable things in the link above.
- What is the outcome of the battle?
    - How much has it impacted Elsevier's bottom line?
    - How much has it saved universities?
    - I don't know.
    - It seems that more new papers published open-access. But what about old papers? We need them too.

    - The battle might also have sparked the creation of these websites?

- What can you do to help solve that?
    - I have a proposal below that I hope is useful, but I'm not sure.

- [WP: Academic publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_publishing)
- [WP: Scientometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientometrics)
    - What are some metrics used to measure an academic resource?
        - Impact factor, "a measure reflecting the yearly average number of citations to recent articles published in that journal" ([Wikipedia: Impact factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor))
        - h-index, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index#Calculation
    - Are those metrics good? Do they create perverse incentive? Are people gaming the system?
        - I know someone who coauthors more papers than everyone in my university *combined*.
            - Is it possible to coauthor that many papers?
            - Is he efficient?
            - Is he cheating?
                - Perhaps he should be thanked, but he is not an author?
                    - What is an author?
                        - If you suggest an idea, but don't write the paper, are you an author?
                        - https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jun/05/my-professor-demand-to-be-listed-author-on-research-paper
                    - How many papers can you author in a year?
            - Is my university incompetent?
- Why are there so many academic journals?

## Proposal for academic publishing reform: Separate peer review and physical dissemination

*Attach reputation to reviewers, not journals.*
To humans, not institutions.
What is important is not where an article is published,
but *who reviews the article*.
There are no important journals.
There are only important reviewers.

Alternatively, *make the reviewers own the journals*.
Profit-seeking is not evil on its own.
Neither is monopoly.
But together they screw buyers.

Incentivize academics to publish openly on the Internet instead on closed journals.

Make a website for peer-reviewing articles.
