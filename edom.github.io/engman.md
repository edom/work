- Why do we need software engineering managers?
    - Because Page & Brin tried otherwise with Google in 2002.
        - "And as the company grew, the founders soon realized that managers contributed in many other,
        important waysâ€”for instance, by communicating strategy, helping employees prioritize projects,
        facilitating collaboration, supporting career development,
        and ensuring that processes and systems aligned with company goals."
