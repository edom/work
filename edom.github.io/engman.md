- Attracting and retaining engineering talent (or any talent)
    - Have something you want to accomplish.
        - Have both a *product* roadmap and a *technical* roadmap.
            - Know both *what* you want to accomplish and *how* you might accomplish it.
            - No need to be too detailed.
            Principles should suffice.
            - Product roadmap satisfies the desire to have an impact.
            - Technical roadmap satisfies the desire of mastery.
    - State them concisely.
    - Find people who want to accomplish the same thing.
        - Find people who want to "move" in the same "direction".
    - Talents leave you when their goals and your goals no longer coincide.
    Either they change, you change, or both.
- If there is a shortage of software engineers, then you can only hire fresh graduates and train them in house.
    - You want trainable people.
        - High IQ is a must, but not enough.
        - You also want agreeable people, but not yes-men.
        - People are like chemicals.
        Some form bonds with some.
        Some explode when mixed.
        Some are inert.
        Some are toxic.

- Why do we need software engineering managers?
    - Because Page & Brin tried otherwise with Google in 2002.
        - "And as the company grew, the founders soon realized that managers contributed in many other,
        important waysâ€”for instance, by communicating strategy, helping employees prioritize projects,
        facilitating collaboration, supporting career development,
        and ensuring that processes and systems aligned with company goals."
