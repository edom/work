- [What makes muscles grow? - Jeffrey Siegel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tM1LFFxeKg)
    - nutrition
    - hypertrophy is due to microfracture healing
        - microfracture is due to contraction that is
            - challenging (harder than the muscle's comfort zone)
            - eccentric (shortening the muscle: flexing the muscle while it is extended/stretched out)
- How to retrain muscles killed by sitting?
    - What exercises isolate the glutes?
        - hip thrust against gravity
        - "Its most powerful action is to cause the body to regain the erect position after stooping, by drawing the pelvis backward, [...]." ([WP: Gluteus maximus muscle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluteus_maximus_muscle))
        - "Semitendinosus and semimembranosus extend the hip when the trunk is fixed; they also flex the knee and medially (inwardly) rotate the lower leg when the knee is bent." [WP: Hamstring muscles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring_muscles)
    - Squatting undoes sitting damage?
