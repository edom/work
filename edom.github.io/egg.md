## Materials

- Eggs (chicken eggs assumed)

## Boiling eggs

For efficiency,
you can boil eggs and potatoes together.
Put a lid on the pot.

1. Wash the eggs and potatoes.
1. Submerge them under the water in the pot.
1. Put the pot on the stove.
1. Turn on the biggest fire.
1. Wait until the water reaches rolling boil.
1. Take the eggs out of the pot.
1. Turn the fire to low, just enough to replace the heat lost by the water.
1. Let the potatoes simmer for 25 minutes.

Boiled eggs don't dirty your hand as much as raw eggs
because boiled eggs insides are solid when you crack them.

You can boil eggs, potatoes, broccoli, and other things together.
The key is to take them out at different times.

## Pan-frying sunny-side-up eggs

### Tools

- Non-stick pan
- Spatula
- Stove

### Procedure

Wash the eggs you are going to cook.

Break the eggs onto the pan.
Tap an egg to a hard flat surface
and let the contents drop into the pan.
You can cook as many eggs as your pan can fit at once.

Turn on the stove.
Use the smallest flame.
Close the pan with a lid.

Wait until the egg white becomes opaque.

Wait a while more until it emits an aroma.

Wait a while more until the egg does not stick to the pan.
Use a spatula to test the stickiness.

Flip the egg with a spatula.
You may need to lift and tilt the pan.

Wait until you get the desired doneness.

Turn off the stove.

Eat the egg.

Let the pan cool down for a few hours.

Wash the pan.

## Why eggs?

Pan-frying eggs takes less than 10 minutes.

Egg is a cheap protein source.
One kilogram of chicken egg contains about
130 grams of protein and costs about $2,
thus about 1.53 cents per gram of protein
(in Indonesia in May 2017).

## What to do with the waste?

Eggshell is rich in calcium carbonate.

I don't know what to do with the eggshell waste.
