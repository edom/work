- [Facts Don't Win Fights: Hereâ€™s How to Cut Through Confirmation Bias - Tali Sharot - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyioZODhKbE)
    - To polarize someone is to make him more confident (about a belief).
    - Confirmation bias: People hear what they want to hear.
        - People filter incoming information.
        - People bend incoming information to conform with their preexisting beliefs.
        - Agreements polarize people, but disagreements don't depolarize people.
        - Information agreeing with preexisting belief polarize the believer.
        - Information disagreeing with preexisting belief is filtered out and doesn't depolarize the believer.
    - Key insight: We can change people's behavior without changing their beliefs.

- 2018-08-29 What I learned today.
    - To temporarily defuse your enemy's hatred of you, find another enemy that is common to both of you.
        - These happens in quick succession:
        Coworker A offended me.
        Then coworker B came and offended A in front of me.
        Then I offend coworker B in front of A.
        Then I can feel some agreement with coworker A.
    - The perception of having a common enemy unites people, even if the enemy is fake.

        - This has a concrete recommendations for countering the firehose of falsehood.
    - Trump and Putin use "firehose of falsehood" to assert power, in the same way school bullies do.
    - The only way to take power from them is to dismiss them.
    Media should stop giving them a platform.
    We should refuse to hear them.
    We should not fact-check, because by fact-checking we affirm that they have power.
    We should simply dismiss everything they say.
    Their competitors should counter-flood the media with their own firehoses.
    - I'm sure Trump and Putin are not the only people using that technique.
    I suspect that PKS may be using that technique in mosques in West Java.
