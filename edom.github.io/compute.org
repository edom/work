- What is the theory of computation?

  - What is it concerned with?
  - What are its important results?

- Where should we begin?

  - Should we begin by defining a function, a machine,
    computation, complexity, or a problem class?
  - Suppose we have a function $f : A \to B$.
  - Given an input function $\alpha : A \to S$,
    an output function $\beta : S \to B$,
    and a transition function $m : S \to S$,
    the computation is $f = \beta \circ m^\infty \circ \alpha$.
  - The space of all functions from $A$ to $B$: $F~A~B$.
  - We know that a function is a kind of relation.
    A relation composes.
    $(S, \circ)$ where $\circ$ is associative.
    There is identity relation.
    There is inverse relation.
    Therefore the relation space forms a group.
    The function space forms a semigroup.

  - computation graph
    - ? $M$ /simulates/ $N$ iff a subgraph of $M$ is isomorphic to $N$.
      - $T$ is the type of terms.
      - $M$ is the semantic function.
    - Shortcut
      - The /shortcut/ of $A$ is $B$ where
        $$
          B(x,y) = \text{\\(x\\) is initial, \\(y\\) is terminal, and \\(x\\) reaches \\(y\\).}
          $$
        - $A$ should be acyclic.
      - Alternative names for shortcut:
        [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disintermediation][WP:Disintermediation]],
        immediation,
        curtailment,
        shortening,
        abridgement.
      - Shortcutting is idempotent:
        the shortcut of the shortcut is the shortcut itself.
- Do not confuse a /problem/ and an /algorithm/ that solves that problem.
  - Example:
    Consider $p(x)$ that
    wastes $2^{|x|}$ steps,
    and then returns the leftmost bit of $x$.
    Thus $p \in \ExpTime$,
    but $\Search(p) \in \Time(O(1))$,
    because every string that begins with $1$ satisfies $p$,
    and we can just hardcode any of those strings in the solution of $\Search(p)$.

- rewriting system

  - What does it mean that a rewriting system /computes/ a function?
  - Given more time, a rewriting system can compute more functions.
  - A Turing machine is a rewriting system.
  - What is the difference between a rewriting system and a formal system?
  - What is the difference between a formal system and a formal language?

- Computation graph?

  - What should we name this sequence?

    - The sequence: $x, f(x), f(f(x)), \ldots, f^n(x), \ldots$

      - $x$ is the initial state.
      - $f$ is the next-state function.

    - Trace? History? Path? Computation path?
    - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function][WP:Iterated function]]
    - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration][WP:Iteration]]

- Function $f$ is /computable/ by formal system $S$ iff $S$ has a finite description of $f$.
- Are there one-way functions?
- Mess: next-state relation

  - The /next-state relation/ $N$ is obtained from $T$
    by making a loop for each isolated vertex.
    For each $x$ in the domain of $T$, $N(x,y) = T(x,y)$.
    For each outside $x$, $N(x,x)$.
  - The computed relation of $T$ is $N^\infty = N^\infty \circ N$.
  - The problem computed by the graph is the infinite self-composition of the graph's next-state function.
    Such problem is the smallest $X$ that satisfies $N \circ X = X$.
    It is the least fixed point of $F$ where $F(X) = N \circ X$.
    The nth self-composition of $N$ is $N^n = E \circ N^{n-1}$.
  - An /infinite composition/ $N^\infty$ is a relation satisfying $N^\infty \circ N = N^\infty$.
    The empty relation satisfies this.
    The other one is nontrivial.

- Problem computed by a graph

  - A graph G /computes/ the problem
    $P(G) = \{ (x,y) ~|~ \text{\\(y\\) is the nearest terminal vertex reachable from \\(x\\)} \}$.
    Because the graph is loopless, there is no path from a vertex to itself, a vertex is not reachable from itself.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    terminal(x) = not exists y : E(x,y)
    reach(x,y) = E(x,y) vee exists m ( reach(x,m) wedge reach(m,y) )
    adist(x,y,1) = E(x,y)
    adist(x,y,n) = exists m exists k : dist(x,m,k) wedge dist(m,y,n-k)
    dist(x,y,n) = adist(x,y,n) wedge neg exists m < n : adist(x,y,m)
#+END_EXAMPLE

- Configuration graph as formal system?

  - Configuration /is/ well-formed formula.
  - $E(a,b)$ /is/ iff $a' \vdash b'$.
  - Initial state /is/ axiom.
  - $F \models P$

- Predicate Computation and Search Problem

  - Isomorphism:

    - Language ~ predicate.
    - Predicate ~ set.

      - (A predicate is a unary relation.)

  - Insight?

    - Every predicate $p$
      gives rise to at least two problems:

      - $\Compute(p) = \text{given \\(x\\), compute \\(p(x)\\)}$, and
      - $\Search(p) = \text{find any \\(x\\) such that \\(p(x)\\) is true}$.

    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_problem

  - There are $p$ with slow $\Compute(p)$ but fast $\Search(p)$?
  - There are $p$ with fast $\Compute(p)$ but slow $\Search(p)$?
  - Conjecture:
    For every complexity class $C$,
    there exists $p$ such that $\Compute(p) \in C$.
  - Conjecture:
    For every predicate $p$,
    there exists complexity class $C$ such that $\Compute(p) \in C$.
  - Conjecture:
    For every complexity classes $C \subset D$,
    there exists $p$ such that $\Compute(p) \in D-C$.
  - Conjecture:
    For every complexity class $C$,
    there exists $p$ such that $\Compute(p) \in C$ and $\Search(p) \not\in C$.
  - Conjecture:
    For every predicate $p$,
    there exists complexity class $C$ such that $\Compute(p) \in C$ and $\Search(p) \not\in C$.
  - Problem formation conjecture:
    For every complexity class $C$,
    there exists $p,P,Q$ such that $P(p) \in C$ and $Q(p) \not\in C$.
  - Conjecture of arbitrary pessimization:
    For all complexity classes $F$ and $S$ where $F \subset S$,
    there exists $p$ such that $\Compute(p) \in S$ and $\Search(p) \in F$.
    The letters $F$ and $S$ are mnemonics for "fast" and "slow".

- Lemma: There exists fast $p$ having slow $S(p)$.
- Conjecture:
  For every complexity classes $C$,
  there exists $p \in C$ such that $S(p) \not\in C$.
- Conjecture:
  For every complexity classes $C$ and $D$,
  there exists $p \in C$ such that $S(p) \in D$.
- Formal languages and describable problems

  - Consider the formal language $L$
    with alphabet $\{ z,s \}$
    and formation rules

  1) $z \in L$ and
  2) $\alpha \in L \rightarrow s \alpha \in L$.
     It should be obvious that $L$ describes the set $\{ z, sz, ssz, \ldots \}$.
     This language solves the problem of adding a natural number by one.

- First-order logic

  - Example of terms in first-order logic:

    - $x$
    - $R(x,y)$
    - $R(x) \wedge S(y)$
