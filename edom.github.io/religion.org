** About this post
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: about-this-post
    :END:

This post contains serious questions but no answers.
The questions were made with complete respect to all religions.

*** How to benefit from the questions
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: how-to-benefit-from-the-questions
     :END:

Answer them honestly in your mind.
You can choose to keep your answers to yourself,
so please be completely honest to yourself.

Please do not feel stupid.
Honesty is not stupidity.
Not being able to answer a question does not imply stupidity.

If you are a religious person and you answer the questions seriously,
then these are some possible outcomes:

1. You ignore these questions or refuse to answer them.
   If you think I'm just trying to confuse you,
   please know that I respect your time,
   and I'm trying to help you.
   The questions are hard because they are serious questions, not riddles.
   I'm sorry if what I thought would be good turns out to be bad for you.
2. You invent new rationalizations
   (
   e.g.Â the author is committing a logical fallacy,
   all good people can go to heaven regardless of their religion,
   all religions basically teach good things,
   my religion might not be the best but it's the one I'm most familiar with,
   etc.).

** The questions
    :PROPERTIES:

*** Conversion
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: conversion
     :END:

If a person leaves Islam and joins Christianity,
then Allah will punish him, but Jesus will save him,
so what will happen?

*** Correctness
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: correctness
     :END:

- Is your religion /the/ correct religion?

  - If yes, are people with other religions unable to go to heaven?

    - If no, why don't you try their religions?
      Aren't you going to heaven regardless of which one yours is?

  - If no, why do you still believe in something you know is wrong
    instead of looking for the correct one?

    - If you think all religions are correct, why don't you try other religions?
      Aren't you going to heaven regardless of which one yours is?
    - If you think there's no such thing as /the/ correct religion,
      why do you have any religion at all?
      Why would you believe in something you know is not correct?
      Why would you gamble your afterlife?

If all people with religion can go to heaven,
why not choose the religion that requires
the least effort to go to heaven?

*** Experiments

If parents did not teach their children any religion,
what would the religion of those children be?

Thank you for answering the questions.
I wish you all the best.

- Attacking people's beliefs will activate their amygdala,
  resulting in fight-or-flight response?
- Every religion started out as something good.
  It civilized its community.
  However, after 1000 years, people got too attached to religion, and religion loses its benefits.

  - History of Islam

    - Islam civilized Arabia.

        - Before Islam, Arabia consisted of constantly warring tribes.

      - Before Islam, a man can take an unlimited number of wives.
      - Islam limited it to four, and requires that the man take care of the wives properly.

        - That's a big change: from unlimited to four!

      - There was Islamic Golden Age, but it ended tragically.

        - Are the Gulf Nations allergic to science?
        - What is the Muslim Brotherhood's idea of education?

      - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali][WP:Al-Ghazali]] has a role in the downfall.

- To everyone, especially religious people:

  - Why do you let someone else decide what/how you should think?

** Hypothesis: Before science, religion helped humanity survive.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: hypothesis-before-science-religion-helped-humanity-survive.
   :END:

Religion, superstition, and folk tales had evolutionary benefit.

Before science, religion was humankind's best attempt at understanding reality.

Understanding reality helps survival.

The paranoid is more likely to survive.
