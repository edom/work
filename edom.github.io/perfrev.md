## Why do companies have performance reviews?

Meritocracy?

To weed out bad apples?

Governance?
Minimize risk, not maximize reward?

## Does it do what we intend it to do?

Problem: People tend to talk only about the good things of other people.

Problem: Retaliation.
If A say bad things about B, B will retaliate.
