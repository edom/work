- Some problems:
    - Marketing problem: People don't even know the project exists.
    - Onboarding problem: People want to contribute to the project, but the project's README doesn't have clear instructions.
- How people can contribute (it doesn't have to be code only):
    - Report issues.
    - Help troubleshoot issues.
    - Contribute code.
    - Write documentation.
    - Request features.
    Find things to do.
    Write proposals.
    Discuss proposals.
    - Spread the word in online forums.
    - Help onboard newcomers.
- To improve contributability, open source projects should be standardized, and documents should be written to help the user accomplish a task, not to merely describe something.
- Documentation should be task-oriented.
- The non-software part is important too.

- If you want to attract people, you must have a goal/vision/roadmap.
    - You will attract people with the same goal.
    - If their goal changes, they will leave you, and that's OK.
- Your project must have a readme and a contributor guidelines.
