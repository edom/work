- Books should be shorter.

  - I think a 100-page popular book has only 1 page of useful information.

    - Begin with the most important statement.
    - The rest of the book supports that statement.

- Why do we write?

  - Because someone needs to read it.

    - At least your future self should need to read it.

  - The reader is the writer's reason for existing.
  - If you can't think of anyone who would read it, don't write it.

- What should we write?

  - Something that someone needs to read.

- Why do we read?
  What do we need to read?

  - Why do we need anything?

    - Either for survival or for curiosity.
    - Human brain has evolved two instincts: survival and curiosity.

      - We become anxious when our survival is threatened.
      - We become happy when our curiosity is satisfied.
      - We become bored when we run out of things that make us curious.

    - Thus the root cause of every human action is either survival or curiosity.

  - Thus we read to survive (avoid death) and decuriousify (to avoid boredom).

- Why do I write?

  - *To connect my future self and my past self*.
    Sometimes my past self makes a decision that my future self regrets.
    When that happens, my future self wants to trace back
    how my past self could have made such decision.
  - *To change the world to what I want it to be*.
    I think writing is the most efficient way of
    spreading information and influencing people.
    Telepathic broadcasting would be more efficient,
    but I don't know how to do that.
    Anyway, it's up to the world
    whether they want to change.
  - *To save your time*.
    I'm happy when my writing helps you understand something faster.

- Architecture

  - Each document in this site is a living document.
  - Decision: a website, not a book.

    - Reason: To minimize the readers' effort.

- Rules

  - As long as this site is hosted on GitHub,
    all contents in this site shall follow the
    [[https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/][GitHub Terms of Service]].
  - Ads are OK as long as they don't hamper the reading experience.
    They must not slow down the page.
    They must not cover the content.
  - Pop-ups are not OK.

- The technology decisions for this wiki and why:

  - Use technology that should still work at least until year 2100.

    - Use only free open-source technologies with proven maintenance track record.
    - Enable rebuilding of the website somewhere else quickly.

  - Use Jekyll-powered GitHub Pages. If GitHub screws us, we buy a new domain, move to AWS, and ask Google to reindex.
  - Use GitHub Flavored Markdown. If Jekyll screws us, we switch to Pandoc.
  - Markdown weaknesses:

    - The original Markdown doesn't have tables.
    - Proliferation of incompatible dialects.

  - Wiki vs blog, page vs post

    - A page is timeless. Its usefulness should not depend on time.
      Old pages are still useful.
    - A post is time-sensitive. Its usefulness depends on time.
      Old posts are useless.
    - Posts are good for news, updates, changelogs, diffs.

  - Alternatives?

    - http://community.schemewiki.org/
    - http://www.nongnu.org/skribilo/
    - Skribilo is a free document production tool that takes a structured document representation as its input
      and renders that document in a variety of output formats: HTML and Info for on-line browsing, and Lout and
      LaTeX for high-quality hard copies.

    - Jekyll 3.4.3 requires Ruby 2.
    - [[https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/][Download Ruby 2.4.1]].
    - Run:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
        sudo apt-get install libssl-dev bison

  - What should we write?

    - Answers from pragmaticism and capitalism:

      - Write something that our intended audience find /useful/.
      - Treat our writing as /asset/.
      - Ask ourselves: what problem are we solving?

    - We can write anything you want to,
      but we will be a better writer
      if we understand /why people read/.
    - /People read to solve their problems./

      - Some need to fix a computer; help articles fix their problem.
      - Some need to decide if they will invest in a company; reports fix their problem.

    - We want to write something good. What is a good writing?

      - Let me use /pragmaticism/ and /capitalism/ to define a good writing;
        you can later define what is good for you
        according to whatever moral system you subscribe to.

        - Pragmaticism suggests that a good writing is useful
          in the sense that the writing /solves/ the problem of its intended readers.
        - Capitalism suggests that a good writing is
          a /capital/, an asset, a means of production.
          For example, some novels give rise to films, games, and merchandises;
          such writings are great assets that will bring wealth to their owners.
          A writing published on the Internet is also an asset for generating traffic and trust,
          which can sometimes then translate into money through advertising
          (or whatever you can convert others' trust to).
* Gender-neutral third-person pronoun
- Prescription

  - I use "he" as both male and gender-neutral singular third-person pronoun.
  - Ambiguity resolution rules

    - If the context makes sense for both genders, then "he" is gender-neutral.

- Languages without this problem

  - Indonesian has gender-neutral third-person pronoun "dia" and "beliau".

* Writing for screen
- Design your text so that the reader can read it continuously and can resume arbitrarily.
  - A page should be finishable in one sitting (about 15 minutes perhaps?).
  - Links?
    - Links should be clumped together, not scattered.
      - Links distract. They break the continuity/immersion of the reading.
  - Design the branching points such that readers understand what to expect by following the links.
- Difference
  - No progress indicator.
    - On paper, your hand tells you how far you are from the end of the book.
    - On screen, you have no idea where you are.
  - No position indicator.
    - On paper, you can mark a page and resume reading later.
    - On screen, you can bookmark a page.
  - Navigation: linear vs tree
    - On paper, navigation is mostly linear: you go to the next page.
      Occasionally you jump to the table of contents.
      - On screen, navigation is tree.
        - Following links depth-first risks forgetting the original context.
        - Following links breadth-first risks browser tab count explosion.
- Which feels better: flip pages of paper, or navigate several hyperlinks?

  - It gives the example sentence: "While Bob ate an apple was in the basket."

* My opinions about writing
** Paragraphs should be replaced with bulleted lists.
- One list item may contain more than one sentences.
