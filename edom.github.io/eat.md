- How long to lose fat?
    - Weight changes very slowly, about 0.5 kg per week, too slow for us to realize.
    Time flies by, and suddenly it's been 2 months since you begin eating junk food,
    and now your pants don't fit.
    You gain 0.5 kg per week over one year,
    but you expect to lose those 26 kg in a week,
    which is not realistic.
    - 1 gram fat is 9 kcal.
    1 kg fat is 9000 kcal.
    If daily deficit is 1000 kcal (this may be too big; it will make you feel shit),
    you need 9 days to lose 1 kg.
    Losing 10 kg of fat won't take sooner than 90 days (3 months).
    - Focus on strength and health, not weight.

- What is the best staple food? Do we need staple food at all?
    - [WP: Staple food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food)
    - Banana is the most practical staple food?
    Portable.
    Affordable.
    Perennial.
    Edible raw.
    No cooking required.
    Low poisoning risk.
    Ready in 5 seconds.
    Faster than fast food.
    [People in Uganda eat bananas](https://muzunguinkampala.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/food-food-food-learn-to-eat-the-ugandan-way/).
    Too much potassium?
    Hyperkalemia?
    - Banana spoils more easily than potato.
    - Potato needs washing and 20 minutes of simmering.
    - Wikipedia has a
    [table comparing the nutritional contents of common staple foods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food#Nutritional_content).
    - Bananas?
    Don't need cooking.
    Have less poisoning risk than potato;
    Have no solanine.
    More hygienic (hanging in treetops, not buried in soil).
    Have shorter shelf life than potato.
    - Per kilogram, banana is slightly more expensive than potato: $2.30 vs $2.10.
    By bananas I mean the Cavendish banana.
    - I'll just eat bananas instead of potatos for carbohydrate.
    - Banana is a fruit; potato is a tuber.
    - Pan-frying egg takes 10 minutes.
    - Can boil eggs and potatos together.
    - Carrots grow in soil.
    - Broccoli?
    Beans?
    Cauliflower?
    - Fruits are faster than fast food.
    No need to cook.
    No need to wait.
    Just peel and eat.
    - Cooking
        - Frying is faster than boiling.
        Boiling is faster than steaming.
        Therefore frying uses less gas.
        - LPG flame temperature is constant (the blue flame temperature is about 2000&nbsp;K).
        Flame size affects the heat transfer rate.
        Make sure that the utensil cover the ring.
        Undersized utensils waste the flame heat.
    - Foods I like
        - Banana is perhaps the easiest food for me.
        - Foods easy to cook:
            - Eggs
            - Bok choy

        - Boiling garlic in milk.
        - Would you eat pesticides, antibiotics, or hormones?
        Which is the least dangerous?
        - Sunkist orange is hard to open.
        - Apples? Too hard on the teeth.
        - Avocados? Expensive. Take too long to ripen.
