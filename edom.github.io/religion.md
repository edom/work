### About this post

This post contains serious questions but no answers.
The questions were made with complete respect to all religions.

#### How to benefit from the questions

Answer them honestly in your mind.
You can choose to keep your answers to yourself,
so please be completely honest to yourself.

Please do not feel stupid.
Honesty is not stupidity.
Not being able to answer a question does not imply stupidity.

If you are a religious person and you answer the questions seriously,
then these are some possible outcomes:

1. You ignore these questions or refuse to answer them.
If you think I'm just trying to confuse you,
please know that I respect your time,
and I'm trying to help you.
The questions are hard because they are serious questions, not riddles.
I'm sorry if what I thought would be good turns out to be bad for you.
1. You invent new rationalizations
(e.g.
the author is committing a logical fallacy,
all good people can go to heaven regardless of their religion,
all religions basically teach good things,
my religion might not be the best but it's the one I'm most familiar with,
etc.).

### The questions

#### Conversion

If a person leaves Islam and joins Christianity,
then Allah will punish him, but Jesus will save him,
so what will happen?

#### Correctness

- Is your religion *the* correct religion?
    - If yes, are people with other religions unable to go to heaven?
        - If no, why don't you try their religions?
        Aren't you going to heaven regardless of which one yours is?
    - If no, why do you still believe in something you know is wrong
    instead of looking for the correct one?
        - If you think all religions are correct, why don't you try other religions?
        Aren't you going to heaven regardless of which one yours is?
        - If you think there's no such thing as *the* correct religion,
        why do you have any religion at all?
        Why would you believe in something you know is not correct?
        Why would you gamble your afterlife?

If all people with religion can go to heaven,
why not choose the religion that requires
the least effort to go to heaven?

#### Experiments

If parents did not teach their children any religion,
what would the religion of those children be?

### Closing

Thank you for answering the questions.
I wish you all the best.
