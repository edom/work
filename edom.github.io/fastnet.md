Every time Fastnet goes down when
I want to connect to the Internet,
I'll write here.

2017-06-15 00:00 +0700 it went down.
04:00 I went to bed, and it was still down.
It went up again some time between 04:00 and 10:30.
The downtime was more than 4 hours.

2017-08-11 00:00 +0700 it went down.
2017-08-11 02:30 +0700 it went up.
The downtime was 2 hours 30 minutes.

2017-08-24 08:00 +0700 it went down.
2017-08-24 12:24 +0700 I left home for office; it was still down.
2017-08-25 02:00 +0700 I went home from office; it had gone up.
The downtime was less than 18 hours.
I forgot to ask the people at home how long it had been down.

2017-10-09 11:00 +0700 it went down.
They said it would go up on 2017-10-10 23:00 +0700 (24 hour downtime).
2017-10-10 03:23 +0700 it hadn't gone up.
It finally went up, but I didn't note when.
