** <2018-11-30> This is a book in progress!
I don't know whether I will ever finish this.

By "See file X" I mean a file somewhere in [[https://github.com/edom/work][my Github repository]].

Who might you be?
How might this book serve you?
- a programmer used to C, C++, Java, PHP, Ruby, Python
- a programmer used to Lisp, Scheme, Haskell
- a Prolog believer
- a Prolog evangelist
- someone who used to write Prolog codes
- a dreamer who thinks machines should do more
- a researcher, theoretician, computer scientist, mathematician, logician, philosopher?
- (Who else might you be, why the hell are you here, and how should I write for you?)

We are wearing multiple hats:
- mathematician
- philosopher
- engineer

The goal of this book is to convince you that you should use Prolog to create your next system (what system? game? enterprise application? shell script?).

Ivan Bratko has a "Prolog programming for artificial intelligence" book.
I want a "Prolog programming for everything" book.
** Warning about the woes and blockers
I'm selling you Prolog here, but let me be honest:
Don't buy it if any of these year-2018 deal-breakers are an issue for you.
Prolog isn't ready for these use cases in 2018; I hope these will change.

<2018-12-09>
Somewhat fatal:
ISO Prolog open/4 has no way to open a file for writing without truncating it.
(How the hell did they overlook such a common use case?)
But some implementations have extensions to work around that:
- Prolog implementations that can open a file for both reading and writing:
  - <2018-12-09> Amzi! Prolog open/4 has "readwrite" mode[fn::https://www.amzi.com/manuals/amzi/pro/ref_io.htm]
- Prolog implementations that can open a file for writing without truncating it, but not for both reading and writing:
  - <2018-12-09> SWI-Prolog open/4 has "update" mode[fn::http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=open/4]
  - <2018-12-09> ECLiPSe Prolog open/4 has "update" mode[fn::http://eclipseclp.org/doc/bips/kernel/iostream/open-4.html]
- Prolog implementations that /cannot/ open a file for writing without truncating it:
  - <2018-12-09> GNU Prolog[fn::http://www.gprolog.org/manual/html_node/gprolog034.html#open%2F4]
  - <2018-12-09> SICStus Prolog[fn::https://sicstus.sics.se/sicstus/docs/4.2.1/html/sicstus/mpg_002dref_002dopen.html]
  - <2018-12-09> Ciao Prolog[fn::https://ciao-lang.org/docs/1.14/13646/CiaoDE-1.14.2-13646_ciao.html/streams_basic.html#open/4]

<2018-11-30>
No arrays.

<2018-11-30>
SWI-Prolog is honest:
"The main weakness of Prolog are algorithms that require destructive assignment,
intensive array processing or bare-metal performance for e.g., processing pixels."
 [fn::http://www.swi-prolog.org/FAQ/PrologLAMP.txt]

<2018-10-24>
There is no standard date/time/calendar library?
There may be one?
I'm still looking.
library(julian)?
- Java 8 has "java.util.time".
  Previous Java versions can use "Joda Time".
- Haskell has the "time" package ("Data.Time" module).
*** <2018-11-22> Prolog weakness: binary array and low-level input-output
Prolog doesn't have arrays.

Workaround: we can fake an array:
Allocate with functor(T,F,N), read with arg(N,T,A), and write with nb_setarg(N,T,A).

Prolog doesn't have unsigned integers.

How fast is this?

This requires that the implementation doesn't limit functor arguments.
** If you need to be hyped up
(You can skip this.)

<2018-11-30>
Don't take this too seriously.
I'm on a honeymoon with Prolog.

Prolog is a /mind augmentation language/.
Prolog is a mental prosthesis.
With prosthetic arms, I can beat you in arm wrestling.
With prosthetic legs, I can beat you in running.
With prosthetic minds, I can beat you in thinking.
If logic is the language of thought, then Prolog is the closest thing we have to mind dump.
Offload your reasoning to computers.
As Leibniz said, "Let us calculate!"

You love Lisp macros?
Prolog has term_expansion/2, goal_expansion/2, op/2, and the infix operators that you have been dreaming of!

You love Haskell type system?
In Prolog you can write your own type systems!

You love C++ operator overloading?
In Prolog you can define your own operators with their precedences and associativities!

You want to beat/outdo/one-up your coworkers?
Prolog is perfect for that!
Unless you're low-level-programming,
Prolog is the secret weapon that multiplies your productivity by 20 compared to a low-level programming language such as C, C++, Java.
When you build your home, you don't build your own bricks.

Your coworkers are beating you with Prolog?
Well, what the hell are you waiting for?
Learn Prolog now, or lose your job and die in oblivion!

"Prolog is a convenient language in which to express the semantics of other languages."[fn::https://www3.hhu.de/stups/prob/index.php/Why_Prolog%3F]

Why logic programming?
Because logic is the internal language of thought.
It is the highest level programming possible, until we invent telepathy.
Don't we dream about programming directly in the language of thought?

A paragraph from Kowalski 1974 \cite{kowalski1974predicate}:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
As a programming language, predicate logic is the only language which is entirely user-oriented.
It differs from existing high-level languages in that it possesses no features which are meaningful in only machine-level terms.
It differs from functional languages like LISP, based on the \(\lambda\)-calculus, in that it derives from the normative study of human logic,
rather than from investigations into the mathematical logic of functions."\cite{kowalski1974predicate}
#+END_QUOTE

"Prolog is an excellent programming contest language:
Prolog is close enough to the ultimate specification language (logic), so that the distance between problem and solution is not too big."
\cite{demoen2005first}
** Not sure yet? Try Prolog with minimal investment.
If you're not sure yet, I suggest that you
read [[https://www.metalevel.at/prolog][Markus Triska's book "The power of Prolog"]]
while doodling some code on [[http://pengines.swi-prolog.org/apps/swish/index.html][SWISH online Prolog interpreter]].
** Comparing Prolog implementations?
I use SWI-Prolog because it's what I used in university, and because of this [[http://www.swi-prolog.org/features.html][SWI-Prolog sales pitch]].

This book assumes that the reader uses SWI-Prolog 7.6.4.

There are many Prolog implementations.
Some companies have their own Prolog implementations.

GNU Prolog is "a native-code compiler which produces standalone executables which donâ€™t rely on any byte-code emulator or meta-interpreter."
 [fn::https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/On-the-Implementation-of-GNU-Prolog-Diaz-Abreu/2c4f697f96202f988602e88c49625a862a4ce696]
But as of 2019 GNU Prolog does not have a module system.

What can we conclude from Wikipedia?[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Prolog_implementations]?

Comparison between SWI Prolog, YAP, GNU Prolog.[fn::http://www.david-reitter.com/compling/prolog/compare.html]

How current is this?[fn::http://www.fraber.de/university/prolog/comparison.html]

Prolog in JavaScript/browser[fn::http://tau-prolog.org/]

Questions that we should answer, for each implementation:
- Who uses it?
  How many people use it?
- What is its strengths?
- What is its weaknesses?
- Where is its source code?
- Does the project seem alive?
- Where is the community?

The first impression to me is that XSB Prolog has stronger theoretical foundation
and SWI-Prolog has stronger practical implementation.
** <2019-03-26> Is there any Prolog IDE?
SWISH?
 [fn::http://www.swi-prolog.org/IDE.html]
 [fn::https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5277263/good-ide-to-get-started-with-prolog]

I use VSCode.
There may be other IDEs, but I don't know which one is supported.
It's one of the woes of using an unpopular language: Few people are working on the tools.

<2018-12-10> Smart editors are dangerous! Arbitrary code execution!

I use the VSCode extension VSC-Prolog, but I disabled its linter after I realize that it may execute arbitrary code.
I only use its syntax highlighting and documentation popup feature.
Fortunately the plugin is still very useful without the linter.

Imagine this file:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
% doom.pro
:- shell('touch ~/doomed').
#+END_EXAMPLE

I loaded that file into VSCode, and a file named =doomed= appeared in my home directory.
I'd be really doomed if someone replaced that command with 'rm -rf /'.

Perhaps we should make a whitelist of allowed directives?

Vim suffers the same thing with its modelines. I think it's now disabled by default?

However, this doesn't affect you if you only open what you write yourself, and never open a criminal's Prolog code.
But this is an accident waiting to happen!

* Set-up and workflow
We assume that you have installed SWI-Prolog 7.6.4.
** Things to do in each OS reinstall
This has to be at least once.
This may have to be redone every time we replace our operating system, such as when replacing Ubuntu 14.04 with Debian 9.
*** <2018-10-20> Installing SWI-Prolog 7.6.4 on Ubuntu 14.04
If you are using Ubuntu 14.04, follow my instructions below.
If your operating system has packaged SWI-Prolog 7.6.4 or newer, use it.
Otherwise, follow the [[http://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html][official instructions]] and find SWI-Prolog 7.6.4.

The following guide is for installing SWI-Prolog 7.6.4 on Ubuntu 14.04.

Uninstall existing SWI-Prolog installations.
The version packaged with Ubuntu 14.04 is too old (6.6.4).
SWI-Prolog 7 introduces a new double-quoted string type.

Install dependencies.
I take this from the [[http://www.swi-prolog.org/build/Debian.html][Debian build instructions]] with these changes.
I replace =libunwind-dev= with =libunwind8-dev=.
I remove =openjdk-8-jdk= and =junit=.
I add =libreadline-dev=.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sudo apt-get install \
        build-essential autoconf curl chrpath pkg-config \
        ncurses-dev libreadline-dev libedit-dev \
        libunwind8-dev \
        libgmp-dev \
        libssl-dev \
        unixodbc-dev \
        zlib1g-dev libarchive-dev \
        libossp-uuid-dev \
        libxext-dev libice-dev libjpeg-dev libxinerama-dev libxft-dev \
        libxpm-dev libxt-dev \
        libdb-dev \
        libpcre3-dev \
        libyaml-dev \
        libreadline-dev
#+END_EXAMPLE

That doesn't include the documentation dependencies because they are too big.
Just read the documentation online.

After apt-get finishes, for security (avoiding sudo cache), close that terminal, and open a new one.

Download the [[http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable][source]].

Check the checksum using sha256sum.

=cp -p build.templ build=

=mkdir -p $HOME/.local=

Edit =build= script.
Set =PREFIX= to =$HOME/.local=.
Uncomment the =--link= option in =EXTRACFG= variable.

Run =./build=.
It should take a few minutes (about 5 minutes on my 4-core 8-GB-RAM machine).

Ensure that =$HOME/.local/bin= is in your =PATH=.
For example, I have this line somewhere near the end of my =~/.bashrc= file:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you edit your bashrc, close your terminal and open a new one.
Then enter =swipl --version= in the new terminal.
The program should show something like this:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
SWI-Prolog version 7.6.4 for x86_64-linux
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you don't want to edit your bashrc, you can run swipl by its full path =~/.local/bin/swipl=.
*** Enabling readline
We want readline for history (Ctrl+R, Ctrl+S) and completion (Tab, Ctrl+P/Up, Ctrl+N/Down).

To keep the entire codebase under BSD license,
SWI-Prolog doesn't enable the GPL-licensed GNU readline by default.
But you can tell SWI-Prolog to use readline.
First, install your distro's libreadline-dev package.
Then, put this line in your =~/.swiplrc=:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:- set_prolog_flag(readline, readline).
#+END_EXAMPLE

Related: [[https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/issues/issues/72][GitHub issue #72]]: "how to build with GNU readline on linux".

** Workflow
*** Starting the interpreter and the documentation server
I start SWI-Prolog with this command line:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
swipl --pldoc=DocPort -l PrologFile
#+END_EXAMPLE

I use 4002 for DocPort.

I open [[http://localhost:4002/pldoc/]] in my browser.
*** Thinking and editing
I edit some Prolog source files in Visual Studio Code with vim key bindings
because I often need to duplicate a line when adding a new clause.

I add statements or comments.

I think a lot about names, representations, and relations.

To edit the source of a thing in PceEmacs, we have several options:
- click the "Edit file" or "Edit predicate" button in pldoc server, or
- query =edit(Name)= or =edit(Name/Arity)= in the interpreter.
*** Rebuilding
To see the updated documentation,
I click "Make & Reload" button in my pldoc website, if I haven't done so.
If I have clicked that button, I simply refresh my browser with F5 or Ctrl+R.

To test the program, I query =make.= in the interactive prompt, and I enter some queries.

Warnings are errors.
If there is a warning, I go back to editing.
"Singleton variables" most likely mean there's a typo.
*** Trying and manual testing
Important: /Prolog source file and Prolog query prompt have different syntax./
A Prolog source file contains /statements/.
The Prolog interpreter accepts /queries/.
Pasting a file into the interpreter does /not/ load the file;
this is contrary to Lisp/Python/Ruby interpreters.

The prompt =?-= means that the interpreter is expecting a /query/.
However, we can enter temporary statements:
- Type the query =[user].=.
  The prompt changes to =|:=.
  We're now at the statement prompt.
  (The syntax =:- [foo].= is shorthand for =:- consult(foo).= which is documented in [[http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=consult/1][consult/1]].)
- Enter several lines of statements.
- End with a new line and Control+D.
  We're now back at the query prompt.

Those temporary statements disappear when the interpreter quits.

Usually, after trying my changes, I go back to thinking and editing.
*** Seeing source codes and finding definitions
To show the canonical representation (properly-parenthesized tree form) of a term, query =write_canonical(Term)=.

To see the source code of a predicate, query =edit(Name)= or =edit(Name/Arity)= or =listing(Module:Name)= or =listing(Name)=.
We can see the source code of libraries.
We can easily find where things are defined.
*** Troubleshooting: tracing and spying
Having to use the tracer means I have failed to design unsurprising programs.
It means that my past self have failed to communicate to my future self.

Sometimes I query debug/0 to disable optimizations so that errors have full stack trace.
Sometimes I need to restart the interpreter and query debug/0 before running my development web server.
See also nodebug/0.

I start tracing a goal with the query =trace, Goal.=
In the tracer prompt:
- =a= aborts (calls abort/0; goes back to toplevel interpreter prompt)
- =c= creeps ("step into" in modern debugger parlance)
- =s= skips ("step over" in modern debugger parlance)
- =l= leaps ("run" in modern debugger parlance)
- Type =/f= in the tracer prompt to run to the next failure.

I stop tracing by notrace/0.

TODO spy/1, tspy/1

trace/0, gtrace/0, notrace/0

*** Committing to a Git repository
I commit my work to Git repository with Emacs Magit or git-gui.
I sanity-check the tree with =gitk --all=.
I push my work to my GitHub work repository.
* Understanding Prolog
There are several models (ways of understanding what a Prolog program does):
- procedural
- database/relational
- functional
- logic

The procedural way is what /actually/ happens.

Sometimes an abstraction fails, and we have to know what is really going on under the abstraction.
** Should we introduce Prolog as a database or as a programming language?
Perhaps it helps to introduce Prolog as a deductive /database/ instead of as a /programming/ language.

The working of Prolog can be summarized this way:
- A database is a collection of Horn clauses.
  - A Horn clause is an implication whose antecedent is an atomic formula.
- To prove A /and/ B, prove A /then/ prove B.
  (Prolog operational semantics.)
  - The order of clauses matters.
    Prolog tries clauses in the order they appear.
** What does Prolog code look like and what does it mean?
A Prolog program is a collection of Horn clauses?
*** Reading Prolog programs, and a crash course to logic
What is the meaning/interpretation of a Prolog program?

A /clause/ has the shape =Head :- Body=.

Usually we begin with genealogy like Abraham's[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham%27s_family_tree].
Family tree is actually not a tree but a directed graph:
Families sometimes inbreed.

The words "father" and "mother" are to be interpreted as verbs here.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
father(abraham, isaac).
father(abraham, ishmael).
father(isaac, esau).
father(isaac, jacob).

mother(sarah, isaac).
mother(hagar, ishmael).
mother(rebecca, esau).
mother(rebecca, jacob).

parent(A, B) :- father(A,B) ; mother(A,B).
#+END_EXAMPLE
*** The meanings of a Horn clause
A Horn clause in Prolog looks like =A :- B=.

A Horn clause can be thought of in several ways.

The operational meaning of =A :- B1, ..., Bn= is that calling the procedure A causes B1, ..., Bn to be called in that order.
This is the actual meaning of Prolog programs.
All other meanings are useful fantasies.

The classical-logic reading of =A :- B= is \(A \leftarrow B\), that is, "A is true if B is true" or "A is implied by B".

The proof-theoretic reading of =A :- B= is "to prove \(A\), it is enough to prove \(B\)".

The search-tree reading of =A :- B1, ..., Bn= is that the tree node A has the children B1, ..., Bn.

These multiple readings are confusing.
For example, the classical-logic reading implies that querying =a= against the following knowledge base should succeed because in classical logic \( A \leftarrow (B \wedge A) \equiv A \leftarrow B \),
but the query =a= actually does not terminate.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
a :- b, a.
b.
#+END_EXAMPLE
In classical logic but not in Prolog,
that knowledge base is equivalent to this:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
a :- b.
b.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Enhancing the declarativeness of Prolog requires /memoization/.

What is the relationship between logic programming, relational programming, logic, Horn clauses, theorem proving, searching, and backtracking?

If each phrase is deterministic (always succeeds exactly once and never fails),
then Prolog becomes a procedural programming language with assign-once variables and unification.
*** The procedural-provability-logic interpretation of Prolog Horn clauses
=p :- q, r= can be interpreted as "to prove p, first prove q, and then prove r".
**** Problem: Horn clauses and biimplications
Classical propositional logic formula \( a \iff b \) (which is equivalent to \((a \to b) \wedge (b \to a)\)) does /not/ translate to this Prolog program:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
a :- b.
b :- a.
#+END_EXAMPLE
Querying =?- a= does not terminate.

This terminates:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
% H is the hypothesis bag.

a(H) :- member(a,H).
a(H) :- \+ member(a,H), b(H).

b(H) :- member(b,H).
b(H) :- \+ member(b,H), a(H).
#+END_EXAMPLE
** What actually happens under the hood?
*** Prolog is a depth-first brute-forcer
But you can emulate other search algorithms too.
**** Non-termination pitfalls, and how to generate terms correctly
Sometimes we forget that Prolog, on failure, backtracks (retries), not stops.

Sometimes we focus too much on the logical reading and neglect the procedural reading.

For example, suppose that you want to generate all lists whose length doesn't exceed 2.

The following is a mathematically correct statement about that fact,
but it doesn't work in Prolog.
It has correct logical reading, but incorrect procedural reading.
If you keep pressing =;=, this will fail to terminate.
#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
?- length(A, LA), LA =< 2.
#+END_SRC

The correct way to do that is to use =between/3= (inclusive):
#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
?- between(0, 2, LA), length(A, LA).
#+END_SRC

We can also use the =clpfd= library:
#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
:- use_module(library(clpfd)).

?- LA in 0..2, indomain(LA), length(A, LA).
#+END_SRC

We shouldn't have to resort to cuts:
#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
% Don't do this.
?- length(A, LA), (LA =< 2 -> true; !, fail).
#+END_SRC

See also:
- https://www.metalevel.at/prolog/nontermination
  - "[Non-termination is] common among beginners, and often lead them to perceive Prolog as 'slow', when in fact their program does not terminate /at all/."
*** Swapped phrases, depth-first, breadth-first?
In this example, there is only a small syntactic difference between =dfs= and =bfs= (it's just flipped order).
Which one exploits tail call optimization (last call optimization)?
#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
bit(0).
bit(1).

dfs([]).
dfs([H|T]) :- bit(H), dfs(T).

bfs([]).
bfs([H|T]) :- bfs(T), bit(H).
#+END_SRC
*** Understanding depth-first search, backtracking, choice points, performance, and cuts
Save this knowledge base into a file, and load it into Prolog.
#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
a(0).
a(1).

b(0).
b(1).
#+END_SRC

Run the query =a(A), b(B).= and press =;= until Prolog fails.

This is what Prolog finds (we remove the newlines to make it more readable):
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
A = B, B = 0 ;
A = 0, B = 1 ;
A = 1, B = 0 ;
A = B, B = 1.
#+END_eXAMPLE

This is the search space (search tree) of that query.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       ?- a(A), b(B).
      /              \
    A = 0           A = 1
   /     \         /     \
B = 0   B = 1   B = 0   B = 1
#+END_EXAMPLE

Prolog traverses that tree in depth-first order as follows:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
- ?- a(A), b(B).
  - A = 0
    - B = 0
    - B = 1
  - A = 1
    - B = 0
    - B = 1
#+END_EXAMPLE

The important things to infer from this experiment are:
- Prolog repeats the work on =b= as many times as the number of ways of satisfying =a=.
  If =a= can be satisfied in N ways, and satisfying =b= is a lot of work,
  then Prolog may do that work N times,
  although the work produces the same result.
- Everything to the right of an infinite branch will never be visited.

What is a choice point?

A cut makes =a(A), b(B)= and =b(B), a(A)= return different results.

How far does a cut cut?

"The craft of Prolog" defines three kinds of cuts: red, green, and blue.
- A red cut destroys the logical meaning of a program.
  Green and blue cuts don't.

** Why was Prolog invented?
If Prolog is the answer, what is the problem?
The problem was the creation of natural-language user-interface.
Colmerauer & Roussel 1996 \cite{colmerauer1996birth}:
"It can be said that Prolog was the offspring of a successful marriage between natural language processing and automated theorem-proving."

Philippe Roussel coined the name "Prolog" in Marseilles in 1972. \cite{colmerauer1996birth}

Robinson 1965 \cite{robinson1965machine}

The key idea of logic programming is the interpretation of a Horn clause as a procedure declaration (Kowalski 1974 \cite{kowalski1974predicate}).

Logic seems to be the internal language of thought.

Elaborated in van Emden & Kowalski 1976 \cite{van1976semantics}.

Predicate logic can be used both for programming and for knowledge representation.

What is "refutation-complete"[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLD_resolution]?

SWI-Prolog goes back to 1986.[fn::http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=implhistory]

Did logic programming emerge from automated theorem proving?
What is computational logic?
What is automated reasoning?

Maarten van Emden has a blog[fn::https://vanemden.wordpress.com].

The relationship between Lisp and lambda calculus is superficial:
van Emden[fn::https://vanemden.wordpress.com/2017/09/08/conceptual-integrity-why-it-matters-and-how-to-get-it/]) wrote that John McCarthy wrote (emphasis mine):
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To use functions as arguments, one needs a notation for functions, and it seemed natural to use the lambda notation of Church (1941).
/I didnâ€™t understand the rest of his book/, so I wasnâ€™t tempted to try to implement his more general mechanism for defining functions.

** <2018-12-05> How to present Prolog to newcomers
This is a draft.
These are slides.
Assume that one section is one slide.

There are several ways to introduce Prolog:
- as a deductive database
- as a logic programming language
- as a procedural programming language with backtracking
- as a natural language processing tool, which is its original reason of existence \cite{colmerauer1996birth}
- as an artifical intelligence tool (what? automated reasoning?)

It may be best to introduce Prolog as a deductive database.
We want people to have understanding and good habit.
*** "Talking" with the computer
We can think of an interactive Prolog session as a /conversation/ with the computer.

The Prolog phrase "append(A, B, C)" means the English clause "appending list A and list B produces list C".

Here we show some ways of calling append/3.

Here we show how to read Prolog fragments in English.

"Prolog, does appending [1] and [2,3] produce [1,2,3]?"
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
?- append([1], [2,3], [1,2,3]).
true.
#+END_EXAMPLE

"Prolog, what does appending [1] and [2,3] produce?"
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
?- append([1], [2,3], C).
C = [1,2,3].
#+END_EXAMPLE

"Prolog, what list do I have to append to [1] in order to produce [1,2,3]?"
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
?- append([1], B, [1,2,3]).
B = [2,3].
#+END_EXAMPLE

"Prolog, what list produces [1,2,3] when appended with [2,3]?"
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
?- append(A, [2,3], [1,2,3]).
A = [1] ;
false.
#+END_EXAMPLE

"Prolog, does appending [1] and [2] produce [1,2,3]?"
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
?- append([1], [2], [1,2,3]).
false.
#+END_EXAMPLE

We press ";" to ask Prolog to find another solution.
Prolog prints "false" when it doesn't find any more solutions.

"Prolog, what list produces [1] when appended with itself?"
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
?- append(A, A, [1]).
false.
#+END_EXAMPLE

"Prolog, what list produces [1,2,1,2] when appended with itself?"

"[1,2]."

"Is there any other such list?"

"No."
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
?- append(A, A, [1,2,1,2]).
A = [1,2] ;
false.
#+END_EXAMPLE

"Prolog, what two lists A and B produce [1,2,3] when appended?"
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
append(A, B, [1,2,3]).
A = [], B = [1,2,3] ;
A = [1], B = [2,3] ;
A = [1,2], B = [3] ;
A = [1,2,3], B = [] ;
false.
#+END_EXAMPLE
*** Write once, run in several directions
The Prolog code for append/3 seems simple.
We can see in SWI-Prolog library/lists.pl [[http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc/_SWI_/library/lists.pl?show=src#append/3][append/3]] (I renamed some variables):
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
append([], B, B).
append([H|A], B, [H|C]) :- append(A, B, C).
#+END_EXAMPLE

Haskell seems simpler:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
append [] b = b
append (h : a) b = h : append a b
#+END_EXAMPLE

But those fragments differ.
In Prolog we can run the code in other /directions/.
There are 3 parameters, each with two directions (input/bound or output/unbound); thus there are 2^3 = 8 possible directions.
The Prolog predicate translates to at least 5 Haskell functions,
for the 5 ways of using append/3 we saw earlier.

We write append/3 once, and we get at least five ways of calling it.

But this beautiful dream crumbles outside pure symbolic logic programming.
*** Another declarative example: palindromes
"A list L is a palindrome iff L is its own reverse."
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
palindrome(L) :- reverse(L, L).
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Why use Prolog for AI?
Because Prolog produces /explainable/ AI.
** Prolog as database programming language
*** Prolog and ontology
Writing a Prolog knowledge base is an exercise in ontology (a branch of philosophy, that studies beings and relationships).
We ask these all the time:
- What exist?
- How do they relate?
- How do we model all those entities and relationships in Prolog for not-too-slow computation?
*** "Pure" relation built from impure parts
We can define a truly relational plus/3 that works for all mode combinations for natural numbers, but the code seems too much and illogical.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
nat(A) :- integer(A), A >= 0.

plus(A, B, C) :- nat(A), nat(B), nat(C), !, C =:= A + B.
plus(A, B, C) :- nat(A), nat(B), !, C is A+B.
plus(A, B, C) :- nat(A), nat(C), !, B is C-A.
plus(A, B, C) :- nat(B), nat(C), !, A is C-B.
plus(A, B, C) :- nat(A), !, between(0, inf, C), plus(A, B, C).
plus(A, B, C) :- nat(B), !, between(0, inf, C), plus(A, B, C).
plus(A, B, C) :- nat(C), !, between(0, C, A), plus(A, B, C).
plus(A, B, C) :- between(0, inf, C), plus(A, B, C).
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can write that shorter in miniKanren which uses iterative-deepening search?

*** Knowledge representation; designing predicates; naming is hard
One possible mapping is:
- a noun maps to a term
- a verb maps to a predicate

Come to think of it, a transitive verb indeed denotes a relation between two nouns.

The name of a predicate is less important than its mapping and its meaning.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
father(abraham, isaac).
beget(abraham, issac).
papa(abraham, issac).
spawn(abraham, issac).
mystery_predicate(abraham, issac).
#+END_EXAMPLE

"A bird eats an apple" means \( \exists x \exists y ( bird(x) \wedge apple(y) \wedge eat(x,y) ) \).

The name of a relation should describe the relationship.

If we intend that there is only one relation between A and B that makes sense,
then we may name that relation A_B.
But:
- What if A or B contains underscores?
- Why do we prefer =father_child= to =beget= or =sire=?

is_thing(A).

A procedure's name should begin with a verb.

Order the parameters from the most likely to be bound.
If parameter A is more likely to be more bound than parameter B, then A should come before B.
Example: Write list_length/2 instead of length_list/2.
Unfortunately not everyone follows this convention.
*** Knowledge representation and software specification
**** Their relationships
- 2010, "Functional-Logic Programming Lecture Notes", Harold Boley, slides, [[http://www.cs.unb.ca/~boley/FLP/cs6905FLP.pdf][pdf]]
  - Knowledge representation in AI roughly corresponds to software specification in software engineering.
  - Declarative programs can be thought of as executable specifications.
  - Invertibility principle (slide 36)
  - Nesting/conjunction principle (slide 46)
  - Unification principle (slide 50)
  - Amalgamation/integration principle (slide 55)
  - That's a long deck: 270 slides.
**** Executable specification?
- lightweight executable mathematics https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/lem/
*** Total relational programming? Relational programs that can be proven to terminate?
A total relation is a relation that is defined for every element in its domain.

If there is total functional programming, then there should be total relational programming.

It is too easy to write a Prolog program that doesn't terminate.
*** The meaning of a pure Prolog predicate
The meaning of a predicate is the set of all ground terms that satisfy that predicate.
Formally, the meaning of the predicate \(p\) is the set \( \SetBuilder{x}{p(x)} \).
Such set is called the /extension/[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extension_(predicate_logic)] of the predicate.

In this example, what is the meaning of t/2 supposed to be?
Declaratively, the query =?- t(A,B)= means the finite set ={(1,1)}=, and thus the query should terminate.
But with SLD-resolution operational semantics, the query does not terminate.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
e(1,1).

t(A,B) :- e(A,M), t(M,B).
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Prolog as logic programming language
*** Multi-directional predicates
A predicate has several uses: iteration, searching, testing, and other computation.
A predicate can be used both to enumerate/iterate a finite set, to search for a satisfier, and to test membership.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
person(alice).
person(bob).

?- person(charlie). % test membership
?- once(person(A)). % satisfy
?- person(A), !. % satisfy
?- person(A). % iterate
#+END_EXAMPLE

A predicate can be used both to enumerate some infinite sets and to test membership.
The programmer is reponsible to ensure that the recursion terminates.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
nat(z).
nat(s(A)) :- nat(A).
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
succ(A, s(A)).

succ(A, s(A)) :- nat(A).
#+END_EXAMPLE

For non-pure Prolog programs, we have to do some repetition if we want a multi-directional relation.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
succ(A, B) :- integer(A), !, B is A+1.
succ(A, B) :- integer(B), !, A is B-1.
succ(A, B) :- !, type_error(succ, succ(A,B)).
#+END_EXAMPLE

But that can be done more elegantly with /constraint logic programming/.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
succ(A, B) :- A + 1 #= B.
#+END_EXAMPLE
*** Functional (deterministic) relation
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
f(In1, Out1) :- Guard1, !, Body1.
...
f(InN, OutN) :- GuardN, !, BodyN.
f(In, _) :- !, type_error(Type, In).
#+END_EXAMPLE
*** How to read declarative Prolog programs
A /Horn clause/ =A :- B= means "to prove A, prove B".
The left-arrow =:-= can be read as "if".

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
wet :- rain.
wet :- sprinkle.

% The same.

wet :- rain ; sprinkle.
#+END_EXAMPLE

The conjunction =A,B= means prove A /and then/ prove B.
Prolog proves them in sequence.

Example:
The fire triangle[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_triangle]:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
% A line comment begins with a percent sign.

fire :- oxygen, heat, fuel.

oxygen.
heat.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Prolog complains about undefined predicate fuel/0.

An alternative in which Prolog does not complain about undefined predicates:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
known(oxygen).
known(heat).
known(fire) :- known((oxygen,heat,fuel)).
known((A,B)) :- known(A), known(B).
#+END_EXAMPLE

We have just defined a small /world/, a small /ontology/.
(Is this too fast-paced for beginners?)

The disjunction =A;B= means prove A /or/ prove B.
If A fails, Prolog backtracks and tries to prove B.

Non-variables in clause head abbreviate unification.
For example, =p(a,b) :- Q= abbreviates =p(A,B) :- A=a, B=b, Q=.

=A :- B= is pure iff all reordering of the phrases of B doesn't change the result?

=\+A= means "fail to prove A".
It is not classical-logical negation.

Every variable is implicitly universally quantified.

The prompt =?- Q= means we ask Prolog to prove =Q=.

Perhaps elucidating
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog_syntax_and_semantics

We often define a set \(A\) with the set-builder notation \( \SetBuilder{x}{\phi_A(x)} \).
We should not conflate a set \(A\) and its membership-testing predicate \(\phi_A\).

A set can be thought of as all the ground terms that satisfy a predicate.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
% person ~ {joe}
person(joe).

% natural ~ {0, 1, 2, ...}
natural(N) :- integer(N), N >= 0.
#+END_EXAMPLE
*** Epistemic interpretation of Prolog programs: Failure as ignorance
Sometimes a Prolog program should be interpreted epistemically,
in which Prolog's /fail/ is treated as /unknown/ instead of /false/.
In this interpretation:
- Succeeding to prove a goal G means that we know that G is true.
- Failing to prove a goal G means that we do not know anything about G.

There are two negations: There is a difference between not/1 and \+/1.
In the epistemic interpretation, "\+" should be read as "unknown".

=\+G= means we do not know G.

Succeeding to prove not(G) means that we know that G is false.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:- multifile not/1.
#+END_EXAMPLE

We waive the law of excluded middle.
In our Prolog program it does not hold that G ; not(G).

Suppose is_big(john).
If is_big(X) fails, it simply means that we don't know whether X is big.

Suppose that is_big(john,true) means we know that John is big.
And is_big(john,false) means we know that John is not big.
If is_big(john,_) fails, then we don't know whether John is big or not.
*** Naming the parts of a list: head, tail, and butt
- "head" is the first element
- "tail" is everything but the head
- "butt" is the last element
*** Defining your own operators
- =:- op(Precedence, Type, Name)=
** Prolog as procedural programming language
Some ugly things are unfortunately necessary.
There are always some dirty jobs in real-world programming.
Example dirty jobs are input-output and error handling.
*** Cuts
- slide 5-28, pitfalls in implementing abs with cut http://users.informatik.uni-halle.de/~brass/lp06/c5_propr.pdf
*** Speeding things up
The first thing to do is to get an unbiased profiler.

(Is SWI-Prolog profiler unbiased?)

Profiling: finding where your program spends time; finding where it is slow; diagnosing slowness

To run your =Goal= with profiling, simply query =profile(Goal)=.

Profiling couldn't be any simpler than this!
*** Functional/expression style sometimes beats relational/unification style
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
-- Functional/expression style
g (f0 x0) (f1 x1) (f2 x2)

% Relational/unification style
f0(X0, Y0), f1(X1, Y1), f2(X2, Y2), g(Y0, Y1, Y2, Z).
#+END_EXAMPLE
Example where functional style wins:
- string formatting
- number crunching

If backtracking isn't involved, functional style wins (is more concise than relational style).

If computation is reversible, relational style wins (half the amount of code of functional style).

We should use both styles depending on circumstances.

We can define a functional/expression/applicative/evaluative sublanguage in Prolog, roughly like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
eval((A = B), Val) :- A = B, eval(B, Val), !.
eval(F, Val) :- callable(F), call(F, Val), !. % lots of hand-waving here
% etc.
#+END_SRC

Haskell is weak against the AST decoration problem.
Dynamic languages (Scheme, JavaScript, Prolog) / gradual-typed languages (TypeScript) beat static languages (Haskell) on the AST decoration problem.
How about Ocaml polymorphic variants?

Should we move from Prolog to Scheme/miniKanren or Mercury?
*** Operators complicate parsing a Prolog source code
*** Zero-arity compound term
SWI-Prolog extension compound_name_arity/3 vs ISO standard functor/3.[fn::http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=ext-compound-zero]

- A function symbol with arity 2 looks like f(x,y).
- A function symbol with arity 1 looks like f(x).
- A function symbol with arity 0 should look like f().

Thus, indeed, SWI-Prolog's extension is the logical way,
but unfortunately we are stuck for historical reasons.
This makes sense if we are coming from mathematics,
in which it is common to conflate constants and 0-ary function symbols.
The formal logic literature conflates f() and f.

Problem arises when we want to distinguish between the x that is a variable reference and the x() that is a procedure call.
We can introduce additional abstract syntax to wrap and disambiguate them: var(x) and call(x,[]).

It is embarrassing that we have known zero for at least 2,000 years and yet we still have problems with zero.
*** Some Prolog negation tricks?
Prolog =\+= can be used to limit the scope of unification, although not the scope of the variable itself.
This exploits the fact that throw/1 does not backtrack in the way fail/0 does.

When using Prolog procedurally, we often want throw/1 instead of fail/0.

It makes more sense to design a procedural DSL on Prolog than to use Prolog itself procedurally.
*** Purifying Prolog?
- assert/2 can be replaced with two parameters (state and next-state).
*** States and dynamic predicates
Suppose that we want to write SQL connection pool.
We need state.
How do we write states in Prolog?
Dynamic predicates is one way of having states in Prolog.
The other is threading two extra state variables in each predicate that uses the state.
But this time purism seems to lose.
In the case of writing connection pools,
procedural programming seems to be the paradigm that produces the most concise and understandable code.

A stateless system is of limited use: They can't store data!
* Graphical-user-interface programming
** <2019-04-02> What are the options?
There are two options for doing GUI in SWI-Prolog:
- PCE: an abstraction layer like GNOME from the 1990s
- plgi[fn::http://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list?p=plgi]: a SWI-Prolog pack containing bindings to Gtk

The future of XPCE is uncertain, but all the SWI-Prolog IDE components use it.[fn::https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/roadmap/issues/29]
It works; it's just not shiny.
Design sensibilities have changed due to new hardware.

PCE is an abstraction layer like GNOME.
It has an object system like GObject, a drawing-primitive system like Gdk, and GUI toolkit like Gtk.

PCE is written in C.

XPCE is PCE + SWI-Prolog bindings.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:- use_module(library(pce),[
    new/2
    , free/1
    , get/3
    , send/2
]).
:- use_module(library(pce_util),[
    send_list/3
]).
#+END_EXAMPLE

The predicates are:
- new(-Object, +Class) is det.
- free(+Object) is det.
- send(+Object, +MessageExp) is det.
- get(+Object, +MessageExp, -Result) is det.

A convenience predicate:
- send_list(+Object, +Slot, +Args) is det.

XPCE /object expression/ (message expression?) syntax is documented in XPCE User Guide section 10.2 ("Executable objects")[fn::http://www.swi-prolog.org/packages/xpce/UserGuide/exeobjects.html]:
- =@Name= global object
- =A ? B= obtainer ("getter" in Java parlance)

PCE is similar to C Gtk or Java Swing.
They are all object-oriented.
** Selecting a GUI library?
Is GTK 3 here to stay?
Is GIR (Gnome Introspection) here to stay?
Is everyone switching from GTK to Qt?[fn::https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/2dxik3/future_of_gnome_and_gtk_when_whole_world_is/]

Why do everyone hate GTK?[fn::https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/7xkcwo/why_does_everyone_hate_gtk/]
From a deleted user:
"GTK is no longer an independent toolkit, it's built by Gnome developers, for Gnome developers.
They change the API in every single new release, which breaks third-party applications, extensions and themes.
They don't care about other projects and developers."

That is fatal.
That is a deal-breaker for me.
I want my software to work forever.

Qt uses C++, and C++ turns me off,
but some people say that Qt is more stable and
C++ is a mature language.
** Enlarge the fonts
XPCE was made in the 1990s when 800x600 screens were common.
In 2019, 1920x1080 screens are common.

The easiest way to set up the XPCE Defaults file is by PceEmacs.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
?- emacs.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Edit > Editor preferences

Increment each number in "display.system_fonts" chain by 2 (thus replace 12 with 14, replace 13 with 15, and so on).

Save the file, exit PceEmacs, and restart the Prolog interpreter.
** Saving PCE/XPCE by porting it as much as possible to pure Prolog?
PCE/XPCE is surprisingly modern?
PCE =catch_all= is Ruby method_missing.
But perhaps this is not surprising because both PCE and Ruby take something from Smalltalk, directly or indirectly.

Need to be done:
- Write a shorter user guide.
  Write about the things that the user really needs to care about.
  People are impatient.
  Life is short.
- Integrate XPCE documentation system and PlDoc documentation system.
- Make manpce use one frame instead of many frames.
  Compare GIMP before single-window layout.

Nice to have?
- Rewrite the C parts in ISO Prolog.
- Build on GTK.

One problem is that PCE is not Prolog-only.
In principle, PCE may also be used with any host language, such as Lisp and C.
** Declarative GUI?
It is easy to model the /static/ structure of a GUI:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
window(main).
textbox(a).
textbox(b).
textbox(c).
contain(main,a).
contain(main,b).
contain(main,c).
#+END_EXAMPLE

It is harder to model the /dynamic/ behavior of a GUI.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
textbox_text(c,C) :-
    textbox_text(a,A),
    textbox_text(b,B),
    string_concat(A,B,C).
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
constraint(text(c) = text(a) + text(b)).
#+END_EXAMPLE

Logical reactive programming?

** Using SWI-Prolog plgi pack
Before building on Debian/Ubuntu:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sudo apt-get install libgirepository1.0-dev
#+END_EXAMPLE
* Maintaining large knowledge bases
** A suggested way to use Prolog for programming in the large?
Begin by defining an ontology or domain-specific language.
This is pure Prolog with declarative semantics.

Then specify a transformation or interpretation to reality.

Example:
A functional programming language:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
%%  interpret(+Expression,-Value) is det.

interpret(write(A), Z) :- !,
    interpret(A, A0),
    write(A0),
    Z = unit.

interpret(A+B, Z) :- !,
    interpret(A, A0),
    interpret(B, B0),
    Z is A0 + B0.

interpret((A,B), Z) :- !,
    interpret(A, _),
    interpret(B, Z).

interpret(A, Z) :- number(A), !, Z = A.
interpret(A, Z) :- string(A), !, Z = A.
interpret(A, _) :- !, type_error(expression, A).
#+END_EXAMPLE

Always use explicit imports and exports.
Help =grep= help us.
** Disciplines for writing large maintainable Prolog knowledge bases
Some disciplines are required:
- Separate declarative and imperative codes.
- Avoid depending on module systems.
- Each declarative source file is a small /ontology/.
  Each imperative source file /merges/ some ontologies.
** Writing extensible knowledge bases
*** Multifile or parametrization-and-catamorphism?
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:- multifile foo_ext/1.

foo(A) :- foo_ext(A).
#+END_EXAMPLE

Catamorphism:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
foo(F,A) :- call(F,A).
#+END_EXAMPLE

Don't multifile if clause order matters.
Reloading changes clause order.
http://www.swi-prolog.org/FAQ/Multifile.html
** Production Prolog
"Production Prolog" by Michael Hendricks; Strange Loop 2014
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_eYTctGZw8
- This mentions "Mercury's bisecting debugger"
- mavis library for optional type declarations
- julian library for dates
- time/1 for measuring how long a goal takes
- library(spawn)?
** Testing
An example of unit testing is in =test.pro=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
test(addition) :-
    1+2 =:= 3.

test(multiplication) :-
    2*3 =:= 6.

?- test_all.
#+END_EXAMPLE

What is this library for unit testing?[fn::[[http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=section(%27packages/plunit.html%27)]]]
** Why do we need predicates at all if we can do with one unary predicate?
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:- op(600,xfy,:).
:- op(650,xfx,@).

invoke(father @ [abraham, isaac]).
invoke(father @ [abraham, ishmael]).
invoke(list_length @ [[], z]).
invoke(list_length @ [[_|A], N]) :-
    invoke(list_length @ [A,N0]),
    invoke(succ @ [N0,N]).
invoke(nat @ [z]).
invoke(nat @ [s(A)]) :- invoke(nat @ [A]).
invoke(succ @ [A, s(A)]) :- invoke(nat @ [A]).
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can even do module systems.

We can encode 1 module as 1 predicate.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
module1(pred @ [Arg1, Arg2, ...]) ...
module2(pred @ [Arg1, Arg2, ...]) ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can encode all modules as 1 predicate.
We can have meta-predicates.
We can have variable-arity predicates.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
invoke(module1:pred @ [Arg1, ...]) ...
invoke(module2(pred) @ [Arg1, ...]) ...
invoke(call @ [F|A]) :- invoke(F @ A).
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can do first-order logic with one predicate only and unlimited function symbols.
We can convert predicates into function symbols:
We can transform \( p_1(\vec{x}_1), \ldots, p_n(\vec{x}_n) \) to \( P(p_k, \vec{x}_k) \).
This is like writing the interpretation function inside the formal system itself.
This is still first-order logic.

Should =a:b@c= be interpreted as =(a:b)@c= (call a:b with arguments c) or =a:(b@c)= (call b with context a and arguments c)?

Abstract terms.
What if we write programs with only predicates and variables and no concrete terms?
Why should we?
Because it enables us to change the representation without changing the meaning of the program.
It is the same as abstract data types in other languages.

We can see an as atom as a singleton predicate, that is, a predicate that is satisfied by one thing only, that is the atom.
** Documentation system
PlDoc <module> documentation should be taken to mean <file> documentation:

** Writing portable Prolog programs
*** Use Logtalk?
Logtalk:
"What an object encapsulates depends on the /base programming paradigm/ where we apply object-oriented programming concepts."
 [fn::https://logtalk.org/manuals/userman/declarative.html]

Object-orientation itself is not a paradigm, but something built on top of a paradigm.
*** Which string representation should I use?
If you don't need to write portable Prolog programs, you can skip this section.

Unless you have to care about portability, use dedicated /double-quoted/ string type (SWI-Prolog 7):
- "Strings are distinct from lists"[fn::http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=strings]
- "Why has the representation of double quoted text changed?"[fn::http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=ext-dquotes-motivation]
- 2013 article "Strings in ECLiPSe 6.2, SWI-7 and YAP"[fn::http://eclipseclp.org/wiki/Prolog/Strings]
  - "With SWI-7 and ECLiPSe 6.2 string support has been harmonized, and YAP is expected to agree as well."
  - "Agreed Common Functionality"
  - "Situation before December 2013"

Non-answer: Edinburgh style: Double-quoted string as list of integer codes (default mode of SWI-Prolog 6.6.4 on Ubuntu 14.04):
A string is represented as a list of character codes.
This was in 1993 ISO standard draft[fn::http://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/images/9/9c/PrologStandard.pdf], but this wasn't in the final version?
Example: ="aaa" = [97,97,97]=.
But this behavior changed in SWI-Prolog 7.

Non-answer: Double-quoted string as list of one-character atoms.
A string is represented as a list of one-character atoms.
Example: ="aaa" = [a,a,a]=.
** How do we manage language complexity?
We use context to disambiguate sayings in natural languages.
For example, "man" can mean a male human or to station people at some places as in "man the guns" or "unmanned vehicle".
We use "table" to mean a flat surface or a data set shown in columns and rows, depending on context.

Ad-hoc overloading is an example of this in programming languages.
We use the same procedure name but different parameter types.

But ad-hoc overloading quickly becomes confusing?
Also, what is the philosophical/mathematical foundation of ad-hoc overloading?
Is it an engineering kludge?
** Not interesting?
Sterling & YalÃ§inalp 1996 \cite{sterling1996logic} presents the logic programming analog of the Gang of Four object programming design patterns.
** Testing
The initial idea of "prorogued" programming \cite{afshari2012liberating} is to use the /user/ as an interactive dummy implementation of stub methods.
The stub implementation is "ask the user for what the return value of this stub method should be".
"Prorogue" is a rare English word meaning prolong or extend[fn::https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prorogue].
But that is not all; types can be prorogued too.
** Logtalk?
"Strong motivation also come from my frustration with Prolog shortcomings for writing large applications."
 [fn::https://logtalk.org/manuals/userman/features.html]
** Logtalk vs library(record)?
SWI-Prolog library(record)[fn::http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=record]
is similar to Racket struct[fn::https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define-struct.html].
* Logtalk
The problem with Logtalk: /too much documentation/,
and unclear which one is authoritative;
no authoritative documentation for onboarding new users.
Two tutorials and one handbook[fn::https://logtalk.org/documentation.html],
and a quick start and a tutorial[fn::https://logtalk.org/guides.html].
Which one am I supposed to follow?
More text does not mean better documentation.
** How do I start using Logtalk?

* Ugly things, awkward squads, states and errors
Simon Peyton-Jones \cite{Peytonjones2000TacklingTA} calls these the "awkward squad": input/output, concurrency, exceptions, and foreign-language calls.
** Effects, side-effects, and errors
*** An effect is what?
What is an "effect"?

What is a "side-effect"?

Does "side-" imply undesirability?

Isn't memory allocation an effect?

What is a "side-effect"?
Wikipedia[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Side_effect_(computer_science)&oldid=855461052][fn::https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/40297/what-is-a-side-effect] is inconclusive.

The "side" in "side-effect" implies that there are /effects/ and /main-effects/, and that side-effects are unintended, unrelated, or unwanted.
The /effect/ of running a program is the change of the state of the universe that results from executing that program.
In medicine, a side effect is an /unintended/ effect, not necessarily bad[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Side_effect&oldid=875244456].
Thus, there is a parallel between chemists-and-drugs and programmers-and-programs:
the designer of a drug (the programmer of a program) /intends/ that taking the drug (running the program) accomplishes the /main-effect/, but reality is a bitch.

What is our intention when we write a program such as a Haskell program =inc x = (x :: Integer) + 1=?
Our intention is that it increments an integer, for /every/ integer, which is mathematically trivial but physically impossible.
The side-effects are: heating up the CPU, taking up some memory, taking up some time.
We certainly did not intend to heat up the CPU; therefore such heating is a side-effect.
Thus the main-effect is the /denotation/ (the mathematical meaning) of the program,
and every implementation detail is a side-effect.

Thus "side-effect" means an effect that we failed to foresee, because the complexity was too much for us.

Side-effects may be fatal.

Spectre/Meltdown are side-effects in that sense.
The chip designers sacrificed understandability for speed.

There is also the phrase "algebraic effect".

We have to distinguish between a /program/ and a /machine/ running the program.
A program does not run by itself.
A /machine/ runs a program.
A program /describes/ a computation.
The machine /performs/ the computation.
A program is passive.
A machine is active.
A program exists in idea-world.
A machine exists in material-world.
A machine affects reality according to the program that the machine is running.
The question: which is the /cause/ of the change in reality: the machine or the program?

If we assume free will, then our thought causes our behavior, and our behavior causes something in the material-world.
*** An error is an unintended behavior, unexpected outcome?
Unintended behavior?
How do we measure intention?

Error is like weed.
They are subjective concepts.
An error is an undesirable condition.
Why are errors undesirable?
Because they complicate programs.

We expect operating systems to run forever.
We expect them to never err.
We expect them to flawlessly reclaim the resources leaked by dead processes.
We expect them to be stable in spite of badly written user programs.

An operating system has to prepare for the worst.
Some difficult errors to recover from are out of disk space, out of memory, and disk failure.
They tend to happen at the most inconvenient time.

Some errors such as stack overflow are fundamental assumption violations.
The only sensible thing to do here is to produce diagnostics and abort the program.

Error handling has diminishing return.
It pays off to handle common errors.
It does not pay off to handle uncommon errors.

Error model:
- cost incurred by the error when it happens in an unhandled manner
- cost incurred by the error when it happens in a handled manner
- cost of writing the code that handles the error;
  this should include the increased maintenance burden due to reduced readability
- probability of the error to happen

Sometimes the cost is emotional and not monetary.
It is hard to quantify emotional costs.
But it is real.
Users hate programs that crash.

Since 1726, an error is a "difference between observed value and true value".[fn::https://www.etymonline.com/word/error]

An error is a difference between what is and what should be.

Midori programming language
 [fn::http://joeduffyblog.com/2015/11/03/blogging-about-midori/]
 [fn::http://joeduffyblog.com/2016/02/07/the-error-model/].

Is an error a side-effect?
Both errors and side-effects are unintended.

Let \(f'\) be what we think a system does.
Let \(f\) be what the system actually does.
Then our error is \(f' - f\) which has to be equal to \(- (f - f')\).
If each of \(f\) and \(f'\) is a logic formula in a structure with domain \(D\) and interpretation \(I\),
then \(-\) is symmetric difference, and negation is made with respect to \(D\).

For example, we think the system implements \( a \).
It turns out that the system implements \( b \).
Then the error is \((a \wedge \neg b) \vee (b \wedge \neg a)\).
Let each of \(a\) and \(b\) be a formula.
Define their symmetric difference \(a - b\) as \((a \wedge \neg b) \vee (b \wedge \neg a)\),
similar to set-theoretic symmetric difference[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_difference].

For example, we think the system implements \( x \mapsto x + 3 \).
It turns out that the system implements \( x \mapsto x + 2 \).
Then the error is \(x \mapsto 1\).

** Error handling and logging
*** Fail, throw, stack traces
Two options: throw or fail.

If backtracking doesn't make sense, then throw, don't fail.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
person(joe).
pair_first_second(pair(A,_), A, B).
#+END_EXAMPLE

Should =person(1)= fail or throw?
Should =pair_first_second(foo)= fail or throw?

Fail means try the next alternative.

If you want throw/1 with stack trace,
you must write it like =throw(error(Something, _))=.

A /function/ should always throw and not fail, when an argument has a wrong type.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
negate(A,B) :- integer(A), !, B is -A.
negate(A,B) :- integer(B), !, A is -B.
negate(A,B) :- throw(error(negate(A,B),_)).
#+END_EXAMPLE

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32968148/why-throw-an-exception-in-prolog-instead-a-simple-fail
*** Structured logging
This is how we log messages in Prolog:
- Design a term that represents the /meaning/ of the message.
- Call =print_message(Kind,Message)= where Message is that term.
- Extend =prolog:message//1= to translate that term to string.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
% Syntax:
prolog:message(Term) --> Lines.

% Example:
prolog:message(Term) -->
    [ 'The term is ~q.'-[Term] ],
    [ 'This is the second line in the message.' ].
#+END_EXAMPLE

Syntax description:
- 'Lines' is a list of 'Line's.
  - A 'Line' has this shape:
    - Format-Args: 'Format' and 'Args' are the same arguments accepted by format/2.
    - Terms of other shapes are converted to string.

The printed message is the concatenation of all 'Line's.

TODO:
- How do we log to file?
- How do we rotate log files?

* Object-logic programming?
** Can we model objects with identities without unique name assumption?
** How do we do/make/model objects and properties in Prolog?
"From a logical point of view, an object, the basic abstraction unit, has a natural interpretation as a logic theory:
/an object is simply a collection of axioms which describe what is true about the object itself/." \cite{ciancarini1993logic} (emphasis mine)

An object is something with identity.
In Prolog, we represent identity with the /unique name assumption/.
Each object has a unique surrogate primary key.
Usually this key is a Prolog atom.
*** Analogy: adding objects to C
In C we can have OOP by adding one "this/self" parameter as the first parameter of each method.
I think it is also possible in Prolog.
But should we?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
object_class(alice, person).
object_class(bob, person).
object_property_value(alice, name, "Alice").
object_property_value(bob, name, "Bob").
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
person(alice).
person(bob).
person_name(alice, "Alice").
person_name(bob, "Bob").
#+END_EXAMPLE

Do we want to parameterize the class?
Note that in Prolog unifying parameters is easier than unifying predicate names.
That is, we cannot write ~P(A) = Q(A)~ where P and Q are variables.

"Mapping Objects to Persistent Predicates"
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f1ec/9e0e24faa1332d0cb60149e1d633b8d2509e.pdf

Should we write our DSL in Twelf instead of Prolog?
http://twelf.org/wiki/LF

"Objects with logic" 1990
https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=100368



The difference between object and value is that an object has identity.

Must everything have a name?

An object has properties.
A property is a key-value pair.

There are several ways to /represent/ such objects in Prolog.

The 1-object-1-term representation represents an object as a ground term.
There are two choices for such term: (1) a Prolog functor whose arity is the object's property count, or (2) a list of key-value pairs.
The meaning of such representation is that iff the list L contains K-V, then the represented object has a property K whose value is V.

The 1-property-1-predicate representation represents each property as a predicate, but this requires /unique surrogate naming/ of the object for identification:
object_property1(O,P).
object_property2(O,P).

It is surprising that database normalization theory explains some characteristics of good Prolog code.

Example:
Suppose that there are two people Alice and Bob.

The question: is the object an /entity/ or a /value/?
An entity has identity.
A value does not have identity.
A natural number does not have an identity.
A person has an identity.
Two people may have the same name while still being two different people.
The same natural number may be referred with a Arabic numeral or a Chinese numeral, but both of them refer to the same natural number.

The 1-object-1-term representation:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[name-"Alice", birthdate-date(1990,1,1), pets-[cat,dog]]
[name-"Bob", birthdate-date(1990,1,1), pets-[cat,dog]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

The 1-object-1-predicate representation:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
person([name-"Alice",birthdate-date(1990,1,1)).
person([name-"Bob",birthdate-date(1990,1,1)]).
#+END_EXAMPLE

The 1-property-1-predicate representation (is this database in sixth normal form?):
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
person_name(alice,"Alice").
person_pet(alice,cat).
person_pet(alice,dog).
person_name(bob,"Bob").
#+END_EXAMPLE
Note that we do not write person_pets(alice,[cat,dog]).

The ontological representation:
kind_surrogate_property_value(person,alice,name,"Alice").
kind_surrogate_property_value(person,alice,birthdate,date(1990,1,1)).

The parameter O serves as an internal name.
The equality of that parameter determines the identity of the represented object.

Two objects can be equal but not identical.

A value has no identity.
An object has an /identity/.

Iff object_property(O,P) is provable, then object O has property P.

Object-oriented programming in Prolog?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28154041/objected-oriented-programming-in-swi-prolog

*** One-property-one-predicate representation of objects
Another core idea is the /one-property one-predicate/ representation, with surrogate primary keys.
This enables us to represent objects in Prolog.
Objects have identities.
Two objects are identical iff their identifiers (primary keys) are equal.
Example:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
person(PersonId)
person_name(PersonId, Name)
person_birthdate(PersonId, BirthDate)
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** OPV (object-property-value) representation of constant objects
Objects without mutation.
Immutable objects.
*** Representation
A class C has properties P1, P2, P3, etc.
How do we represent an /instance/ of C in Prolog?
There are at least two ways: /many-predicates/ and /one-term/.

The /many-predicates/ representation makes it easy to add derived properties.
One predicate represents one property.
This is similar to 6NF (sixth normal form) in database theory.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
c_prop1(InstanceId, Prop1).
c_prop2(InstanceId, Prop2).
c_prop3(InstanceId, Prop3).
...
#+END_EXAMPLE

The /one-term/ representation makes it easy to specify an instance.
One term represents one instance.
This is similar to 0NF/1NF (zeroth or first normal form) in database theory.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
c(InstanceId, [
    prop1 - Prop1,
    prop2 - Prop2,
    prop3 - Prop3,
    ...
]).
#+END_EXAMPLE

But we can combine both.
We can translate an instance-wise representation to a property-wise representation:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:- discontiguous c_prop1/2, ..., c_propN/2.

c_prop1(InstanceId, Prop1) :- c(InstanceId, Props), member(prop1-Prop1, Props).
c_prop2(InstanceId, Prop2) :- c(InstanceId, Props), member(prop2-Prop2, Props).
c_prop3(InstanceId, Prop3) :- c(InstanceId, Props), member(prop3-Prop3, Props).
...
#+END_EXAMPLE

But the many-predicates representation is easier to refactor than the one-term representation.

Conclusions:
- A module may internally specify objects in the one-term (denormal-form) style,
  but should only export predicates in the many-predicates (normal-form) style.
- A translation should not import denormal-form predicates.
* Writing enterprise web applications
** Why do we model things?
http://www.dubberly.com/articles/models-of-models.html
** Modeling the dynamic aspect of software systems as inter-agent dialogs
We can think of a software system as the set of all possible /dialogs between agents/.
- Man queries machine.
- Machine queries man.
- Man commands machine.
- Machine commands man.
- Man queries man, man commands man, machine queries machine, machine commands machine.

An agent is a man or a machine.
An agent is something that can cause something.

An agent may query another agent.
An agent may command another agent.

People must have thought about this before.

"Behymer and Flach build on the idea of collaboration, proposing a model comprised of actors or 'agents', both human and 'automaton'."
 [fn::http://www.dubberly.com/articles/distinguishing-between-control-and-collaboration-and-communication-and-conversation.html]
** Why should we use a modeling language expressive enough to model itself?
(Not yet answered.)

instance_of(O,C) means that O instantiates (is an instance of) C.

class_property(C,P) means that each instance of C has a property named P.

The constraint:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
forall O C : instance_of(O,C), class_property(C,P) -> exists V : opv(O,P,V)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Class-property is its own meta-model.

** Convenient Prolog HTML Expression
CPH stands for Convenient Prolog HTML.
CPHE stands for CPH Expression.
The source file is =html_cph.pro=.

Before you use this library:
- We have only HTML 5 in mind.
  We do not handle DTD, SGML, XML, and all that stuffs.
- We require that the Prolog implementation have a dedicated double-quoted string type, in which a string is not a list of codes.
- We only write HTML and do not read HTML.
- We do not handle all tags.
  See is_tag/1 and is_empty_tag/1 in the source.
- We do not handle comments.
- We do not indent the HTML output.
  It is human-unreadable.
- Security notice:
  We only escape attribute values and text nodes.
  We do not escape attribute names and doctypes.
- Element names must be all-lower-case atoms.

<2019-03-29>
Motivation:
SWI Prolog 7.6.4 library(http/html_write)[fn::http://www.swi-prolog.org/howto/http/HelloHTML.html] was made before double-quoted strings.

To understand the idea, see the following example translation.

The predicate cphe_string/2 translates CPHE to HTML like this:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
p(class=foo, "Text", style="color:#f00;", strong("Strong"))

<p class="foo" style="color:#f00;">Text<strong>Strong</strong></p>
#+END_EXAMPLE

An example of a document:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[
    '!doctype'(html)
    , html(
        head(
            title("Title")
        )
        , body(
            p("Paragraph")
        )
    )
]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Do not conflate atoms and strings.
Atoms translate to empty elements.
Strings translate to escaped texts.
** SQL-Prolog integration sketch
*** The idea
The source file is =sql.pro=.

The initial key idea is a 1:1 mapping between SQL tables and Prolog predicates.
But is it mapping to tables or to SQL SELECT queries?
We can think of a table as a SELECT query.
The key idea is a Prolog predicate that succeeds once for each row in a corresponding SQL table.
What if we can access a SQL table as if it were a Prolog predicate?

It should be possible to make something like F# data provider but with Prolog predicates.
It should be possible to make a Prolog predicate that fetches data when called.

The dream is seamless integration between Prolog and SQL databases.
Seamless SQL-backed Prolog predicates.

Several design choices:
- seamless/proxy-predicate approach: a predicate that uses a connection pool;
  use "proxy" predicates with odbc_query/3; an SQL table with N columns is represented by a predicate with arity N
- dynamic-predicate approach: populate dynamic predicates with data from table
- optimizer-interpreter that works for both Prolog databases and SQL databases; an SQL table is modeled by a term table(Id,Cols)
- The "persistency" library for persistent dynamic predicates[fn::http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=persistency]

Warren 1999: "Prolog is an elegant language for database queries.
In fact if one constrains Prolog programs to use only atoms, integers and reals (no lists or complex terms) and disallows recursive definitions,
one gets a database language that is equivalent to a powerful subset of SQL."[fn::https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~warren/xsbbook/node11.html]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
% employee(Id, Name, Age)

query :- interpret((table_row(employee,E), row_column_value(E,age,Age), Age >= 20)).
#+END_EXAMPLE

Models of SQL SELECT statements:
- select(Table, Columns, Opts) where Opts is the optional parts (WHERE clause)
  - Column is an atom or an "Column as Alias"

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
select(information_schema:columns
    , [table_name as table, column_name as column, column_type as type]
    , [
        where(column_type = "integer")
        , order_by([asc(table)])
    ])
#+END_EXAMPLE

For testing (Do not do this on public/production server):
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
CREATE USER test PASSWORD 'test';
CREATE DATABASE test OWNER test;
#+END_EXAMPLE

Other systems:
- CQL[fn::http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=cql] (Constraint Query Language) encloses its DSL expression in braces.

"There have been some Prolog systems in the past that could store predicates on a file."[fn::https://swi-prolog.discourse.group/t/scaling-to-billions-of-facts/380/2]

An SQL table can be thought of as a predicate that only works with ground terms.
*** Making it work
*** Making it fast
We want to push the filter condition to SQL.
We want to filter as close as possible to the source as much as possible.
We want to minimize the amount of data transferred over the network.
We want to move the computation?
We want to run Prolog on the SQL database?
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
employee(E), employee_age(E,A), A >= 30
#+END_EXAMPLE
*** Incremental/progressive aggregation
We often need to derive OLAP table from OLTP table.
But PostgreSQL materialized view cannot partial-refresh.[fn::https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25641240/is-it-possible-to-partially-refresh-a-materialized-view-in-postgresql]
Often an OLTP table is an append-only log (but sometimes there is "backdating").

Often we want to speed up queries like this:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
SELECT date, SUM(amount) FROM sale GROUP BY date;
#+END_EXAMPLE

We know that the query does not have to be recomputed because we know that there has been no changes to the past data in the source table.

But SQL is inconvenient, so we want to aggregate in the application and cache the result in an SQL table.

It should be possible to capture this architectural pattern in Prolog, and generate the implementation.
*** What else? Other similar implementations?
Jarke, Clifford, Vassiliou 1984 \cite{jarke1984optimizing}

"One of the things that ProLog by BIM had was the ability to have Prolog use Oracle or Sybase databases as if they were Prolog's own native database"[fn::https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12941910]

XSB-ODBC may be similar to what I want.
*** More ambitions: all data sources are predicates, and predicates are iterators
It is straightforward to generalize to other data sources:
JSON, CSV, NoSQL, Redis, Lucene, etc.
SLD resolution makes predicates behave as iterators.

Every object or table-row can be represented by a relation instance.

This is similar to F# type providers.

Prolog is better than Turtle.
http://sujitpal.blogspot.com/2009/06/ontology-rules-with-prolog.html
"I actually set out to learn Jena Rules using the Semantic Web Programming book as a guide.
Midway through that exercise, it occurred to me that Prolog would be a cleaner and almost drop-in replacement to the rather verbose Turtle syntax.
Apparently the Semantic Web community thinks otherwise, since Turtle stands for Terse RDF Triple language.
I haven't actually used Prolog before this, although I've read code snippets in articles once or twice (but not recently), so the realization was almost like an epiphany."

** Ramble: Translating Prolog to native code?
The idea is to relate a Prolog predicate and a C routine.

Every disjunct translates into one routine / basic block.

The current goal relates to the instruction pointer.

Proving a goal ~ calling a routine
Conjunction of phrase ~ sequence of call
Disjunction of clause ~ speculative parallel execution, for pure predicates only

p(A),q(A) can be optimized from O(PQ) time to O(max(P,Q)) time if we order the storage.

Intermediate language
Compile by abstract interpretation
unify(Var1,Var2)
frame(Instrs)
prove((A,B)) :- prove(A), prove(B).

A variable in clause head is implicitly universally quantified.
A free variable in clause body is implicitly existentially quantified.

** Alternative declarative semantics
*** Prolog should use three-valued logic?
Suppose that both A and B are unbound variables.
Then:
- =A == B= is unknown, but it's false in Prolog.
- =A \= B= is unknown, not it's false in Prolog.

In that case, it is better for Prolog to throw an instantiation_error instead of failing.

Three-valued logic would simplify and elegantize constraint logic programming?
*** Declarative programming? Function arguments?
The idea:
A relation's parameter can be a unifiable logic variable or a beta-reducible lambda expression.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
is_one(A : exp(integer)) :- A = 1.
?- is_one(0+1).
true.

f(A : var(integer)) :- A = 1.
?- f(0+1).
false.
#+END_EXAMPLE

TODO
Compare various approaches such as LambdaProlog, Mercury, and Curry.
*** What?
Porto 2011 \cite{porto2011structured}
** Meta-programming
<2018-12-06>
Prolog is the best meta-language I have found so far.
It is a good meta-language for defining other languages.

To define 'macros', use =term_expansion= or =goal_expansion=.
** Constraint logic programming
Why does use_module(library(clpfd)) increases loading time perceptibly?

Should we use clpfd #=/2 instead of is/2?
But it's good to have minimal dependencies.

Motivation?

Consider this program for enumerating the duplicates in an array.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
duplicate(F, I, J, A) :-
    arg(I, F, A),
    arg(J, F, A),
    I \= J.
#+END_EXAMPLE

The compiler should be able to infer the constraints and use it to produce this, reducing the number of comparisons to half the original?
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
duplicate(F, J, K, A) :-
    functor(F, _, N),
    between(1, N, J),
    between(J, N, K),
    arg(J, F, A),
    arg(K, F, A),
    J \= K.
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Advanced logic programming
According to some curriculums, advanced logic programming includes
SLG (tableau) resolution,
constraint logic programming,
and inductive logic programming.
** Language-oriented programming, embedding a language in Prolog
Advantages:
- Reuse all of Prolog.
- Concentrate on the abstract syntax and the semantics, and not on the surface syntax.

Disadvantages:
- No custom syntax error messages, because we embed our language in Prolog.
- Limited to Prolog syntax.
  No array index operator such as =a[i]=.

Several possibilities:
- Horn clauses.
- Custom terms with custom interpretation function.

The 2010 article "Using DSLs for Developing Enterprise Systems" [[https://research.cyber.ee/simpl/enterprise-dsl.pdf][pdf]]:
- It uses the terms "language engineer", "transformation specialist", and "business engineer".
- It defines several usage scenarios of DSLs.
- It defines five criteria for comparing DSL tools.
- It compares some DSL tools.
- It should have been a wiki article.

A relation can be thought of as an interpretation of function terms.
For example, m0/2 and m1/2 give different meanings to the same function term f/1.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
m0(f(X), Y) :- Y is X+1.
m1(f(X), Y) :- Y is 2*X.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Prolog is ideal for writing DSLs because:
- We can embed the abstract syntax in Prolog syntax.
  We can skip specifying the grammar and go directly to specifying the semantics.
- Specifying the semantics is straightforward.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
exp_val(S, T) :- string(S), !, S = T.
exp_val(S, T) :- number(S), !, S = T.
exp_val(A+B, C) :- string(A), string(B), !, string_concat(A, B, C).
exp_val(A+B, C) :- number(A), number(B), !, C is A+B.
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Iterative deepening search with length/1
Prolog uses depth-first search.
It isn't complete.
(What does that mean?)

If you have a query =goal(List)= where =List= is a list,
then you can query =length(List, _), goal(List)= to make the search complete.

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Prolog/Search_techniques
** Prolog = Lisp + operators + reflection + backtracking
Both Prolog and Lisp has terms, read, eval, write, and macros.

Prolog has read/1.
Lisp has read.

Prolog has call/1.
Lisp has eval.

Prolog has term_expansion/2.
Lisp has defmacro.

Prolog has infix prefix, infix, and suffix operators.
Lisp does not have them?
Lisp is all prefix?
There may be some extensions?

Operators facilitate human-reading but complicate machine-parsing.

If we are going to pick a high-level language,
we should pick one that has solid mathematical foundation.
But that is enough.
How about language usability and toolchain?
** All state computations are pure in the bigger supersystem

** Attributed variables
I feel that attributed variables seem to be an engineering hack without mathematical justification.
It interacts badly with term-copying.
** Partial evaluation
A common way to make compiler is to use a parser generator and what?

A possibly better way is to write an interpreter and /get a compiler for free/ by partial evaluation.

Writing an interpreter is much easier than writing a compiler.

"Partial deduction" is partial evaluation from logic point of view.

* Theoretical foundations of logic programming
** Theories of truth
There are at least three theories of truth[fn::http://mrhoyestokwebsite.com/Knower/Useful%20Information/Three%20Different%20Theories%20of%20Truth.htm].
But there are more.[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth]
There is also Tarski's model-theoretic theory of truth.
** Semantics
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2112719/what-is-the-difference-between-herbrand-logic-and-relational-logic-or-predicate

There are several semantics for logic programs:
- Tarski
- model
- Herbrand
- operational

Genesereth & Kao advocates using Herbrand semantics instead of Tarski semantics.
They claim that Herbrand semantics is easier to teach.
 [fn::http://logic.stanford.edu/herbrand/herbrand.html]

Shieber et al. 1995 \cite{shieber1995principles} p. 14 puts it eloquently:
First-order terms "can be understood as abbreviations for the sets of all their ground instances".
** Why does automatic theorem proving use resolution?

** What is wrong with Prolog?
*** The problem with var/1: non-commutativity and non-monotonicity
Usually conjunction is commutative: \(a \wedge b \equiv b \wedge a\).
But var/1 breaks that.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
p(A) :- var(A), A = 1.
q(A) :- A = 1, var(A).

?- p(A).
A = 1.

?- q(A).
false.
#+END_EXAMPLE
*** Why should a logic programming language be sound and complete?
Prolog is unsound.
So what?

(example of Prolog's unsoundness?)

*** How is Prolog unsound?
From \cite[p.~18]{boizumault2014implementation}:
- "The absence of the occur check entails the unsoundness of the resolution strategy used by Prolog."
- "The main reason for this omission is a sensible gain in execution time."

** Is there a general-purpose relational programming language not restricted to databases?
** Which point of view should we use: logic, set, relation?
A relation is not a mere set, but is a /triple/ of domain, codomain, and mapping.
Thus there is a /type theory/ of relations.
** Prolog vs datalog
Prolog is top-down/backward-chaining.
Datalog is bottom-up/forward-chaining.
** How does Lambda-Prolog extend Prolog?
Nadathur & Miller 1988 \cite{nadathur1988overview} justifies Lambda-Prolog.

"The language Lambda-Prolog extends the logic of Horn clauses by allowing the use of implication not just in clauses, but also in goals,"
among other things.[fn::http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~dale/lolli/]

"By moving away from classical logic, Lambda Prolog was able to expand to a much larger fragment of logic: higher-order hereditary Harrop formulas.
This allows some features, e.g. modules, to be handled in a logical way as opposed to the ad-hoc way they are handled in Prolog."
 [fn::https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1761680/what-formal-systems-are-various-programming-paradigms-based-on/1761959]
** How do Lambda-Logic and Lambda-Prolog relate?
How do Beeson 2004 \cite{beeson2004lambda} and Miller & Nadathur 2012 \cite{miller2012programming} relate?
** Predicate logic can be thought of propositional logic with parameters
This fragment looks like written by a programmer who does not know arrays or a logician who does not know parameters.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
handsome_bob
man_bob
handsome_joe
man_joe
handsome_bob -> man_bob
handsome_joe -> man_joe
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then he learns about arrays and parameters, and he rewrites that to \( \forall x (handsome(x) \to man(x)) \).
** Horn clauses, history, importance, why?
<2019-04-13>
It is a shame that Horn's paper "On sentences which are true of direct unions of algebras" is not freely available online.
(Login-wall is not free.)
** Why is Prolog a dynamic programming language?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language

Functionalities such as assert/1 and retract/1 are inherently dynamic.

Why use dynamic programming languages?

Dynamic does not mean lack of checking.
We can write our own checker in Prolog.

Static language = dynamic language + checking

Static languages are usually translated (compiled) instead of interpreted.

The checking is part of the translation.

Writing an interpreter is much easier than writing a compiler
because when writing an interpreter we can reuse all features of the meta-language.
* Artificial intelligence?
** Finding out what to ask; coming up with a question; machine scientist?
Suppose that:
- There is an agent \(A\) with goal \(G\).
- \(K\) is the entire knowledge of agent \(A\).
  This \(K\) may be thought of as a set of Horn clauses.

Define "hypothesis" as "something we don't know but should know"?

The questions:
- What question should the agent ask (and try to answer) in order to optimally increase the agent's knowledge?
- How do we craft/select/formulate hypotheses?

Intuitively, an agent gains zero knowledge by answering a question whose answer is already in its knowledge set.

** Logic of machine comprehension and machine translation?
We can imagine a relation internal_external(I,E)
where I is an internal language of thought
and C is an external language (natural language).

We can see that a relation like english_indonesian(EnglishWord,IndonesianWord)
does not have any provisions for using context to disambiguate meanings.

Now I know this is false:
- Relational programming subsumes functional programming.
  - Functional programming is a special case of relational programming.
  - Every function is a relation.

Functional programming is more concise and readable than logic (relational?) programming when we are describing functions:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
fib 0 = 1
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
fib(0,1).
fib(1,1).
fib(N,F) :- N1 is N-1, N2 is N-2, fib(N1,F1), fib(N2,F2), F is F1+F2.
#+END_SRC

But we can translate a function to a deterministic (det) predicate in Prolog.

    Some people refuse to abandon the dream of programming in first-order logic.
    But we have to ask whether this dream is possible â€” even whether it is desirable.
    The first-order paradigm does not deal adequately with negation in databases, and seems to be an unreliable guide in research on program correctness and language design.
    Inductive definitions are more fundamental than first-order logic, and perhaps easier to understand."

  - 1.16 Styles of encoding knowledge, p. 28
    - parent, male, female vs. father, mother
    - "Which style is computationally more efficient depends on the kinds of queries to be answered."
    - "Unlike other knowledge representation languages, Prolog does not force the knowledge base builder to state information in a particular logical style.
      Information can be entered in whatever form is most convenient, and then appropriate rules can be added to retrieve the information in a different form."
    - "We could use a 'data-record' format to encode the family tree like [person(Name,Sex,Father,Mother)]"
      - "The only advantage of this style is that the multi-argument facts are often easy to generate from conventional databases,
        by simply printing out the data in a format that conforms to Prolog syntax."

      - "If our reasoning is monotonic, the set of conclusions we draw from the information we have only gets larger as we get more and more information.
        Once we reach a conclusion, no additional information will cause us to reject it.
        When our reasoning is nonmonotonic, we may reject an earlier conclusion on the basis of new information."
      - "Human reasoning is notoriously nonmonotonic. We make plans based on what we expect to happen,
        but we constantly revise our expectations, and our plans, as events unfold."
      - "The Prolog inference engine is nonmonotonic because of the way it handles negation."
      - Why is "defeasible" not spelled "defeatable"?
    - 11.2 New syntax for defeasible reasoning, p. 348
      - "Although Prolog can perform some kinds of nonmonotonic reasoning, Prolog rules are not defeasible."
      - "Some instances of defeasible reasoning cannot be reproduced in ordinary Prolog."
      - "What we need is a new way to represent defeasible rules and presumptions and
        an inference engine that knows how to use them. We also need a negation operator
        that is different from negation-as-failure so we can represent rules that tell us
        when something is positively not the case rather than just that we cannot /prove/ that it is the case.
        These negative rules are needed to tell us when we have an exception to a defeasible rule, but they are desirable in their own right as well."

* Rethinking module systems, especially of Prolog
Miller 1986 \cite{miller1986theory} has what we want: implication as local scoping.
** What are the problems of existing module systems?
A module system is often an afterthought to a core language.\cite{miller2012programming}

Chapter 6 of \cite{miller2012programming} contains a desiderata for module systems.
** What problems are modules trying to solve?
*** Two problems that modules are trying to solve
- our only mental weapon, to understand code and combat complexity,
  is divide-and-conquer and abstraction which is often somewhat hierarchical
- name clashes are bound to happen in a large software system

Modules reduce complexity by partitioning and independence.
See [[http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~renaat/ca2/ca214/ca214vii.html][Three Universal methods of reducing complexity]]
from the course [[http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~renaat/ca2/ca214over.html][CA214 Systems Analysis and Design Page]].

Which is essential: complexity management or namespacing?
*** Modules are for humans
Computers don't need modules.
All it needs is a sequence of machine codes.

Given enough memory, a computer can handle arbitrarily big programs.

Human uses modules for organizing things.
Human uses modules to make machines separate compilation, speed up recompilation, and recompile a part of the program.
*** Why do name clashes happen?
Natural languages also have name clashes.

English homonyms.

Why do we have homonyms?

We use language for practical purposes, not for philosophical purposes.
Practically, conflating a thing and its representation makes life easier.
*** How does name clashes happen?
*** The key of avoiding name clashes: Things should not name themselves
Names and referents should be separated.

Philosophically, a name of a thing must not be a property of the thing itself.
A rock does not implore us to call it "rock".
It is we who name it "rock".
My name is "Erik", but you can name me anything,
although calling me with any other name may fail to grab my attention.

If A uses B, then A names B, and B must not tell A what to name B.

Example agreement: JavaScript functions and modules don't have names.
What has a name is the variable that refers to the function or to the module.

Example violation: C functions have names.
*** How do module systems arise?
We are merrily writing codes until our program grows big and we have difficulty finding things.
Then we feel that something has to be done.

We make module systems because we are humans with limited working memory.
Our only weapon against complexity is divide-and-conquer and hierarchical abstraction/categorization.
*** Secondary uses of modules
All other purposes such as encapsulation and protection are secondary while-we're-at-it additions.

- to separate or parallelize compilation
- to protect internal constraints/consistency,
  to prevent the user from using the module in an incorrect way not designed by the module creator
  \cite{haemmerle2006modules}

C does not even try: leave it the programmer.
C++ solution is better but not satisfactory: automatically prefix everything.
JavaScript's solution is fundamentally better: the names of modules, classes and functions can be locally scoped.

Static typing helps name resoution by overloading like in Java and C++.
But this only delays the problem: /the types themselves can have clashing names/.

For example, a car driver does not mess with the internals of the car engine while driving.
*** Modules as protection of internals?
There are two opposing hypotheses:
- Good abstraction (implementation-hiding) increases robustness.
- All abstraction leaks, and the fix requires knowing the implementation.

For robustness, we want caller to depend only on public interface;
we want to make the contract explicit.

Modules are for protecting internal assumptions?
From \cite{haemmerle2006modules}:
- "One difficulty in Prolog comes from the /call/ predicate which interferes with
  the protection of the code, an essential task of a module system."
- "[...] to guarantee the
  semantics of the predicates defined in a library, a module system has however to
  strictly prevent any predicate execution not allowed by the programmer."
- "The /algebraic approach/ defines module calculi with operations over sets of program clauses"
*** What are hardware modules?
An example is an integrated circuit, a black box that performs a high-level function.
Thinking in terms of op-amps instead of in terms of Maxwell's equations.
The essence of hardware module is abstraction.
A module is a unit of reasoning.
If a module breaks down, the user replaces the entire module.
The module creator designs the module such that the module user can think at a higher level of abstraction.
*** Ciao Prolog module system?
\cite{cabeza2000new}
** How should modules and meta-predicates interact?
*** What is the name of a thing?
The question boils down to "What is the name of a thing?"
*** What should call/1 mean? What is the reason for atom-based module systems?
We propose two principles for call/1: /transparency/ and /lexical binding/,
because they simplify reasoning about the program.

Without modules, the meaning of =call(foo(A))= is straightforward:
It is as if the programmer had written =foo(A)= instead.

/Transparency/ means that textually replacing =call(A)= with =A= in the source code should preserve the meaning of the program.
The semantics of =call(A)= should be the same as the semantics of =A=.

/Lexical binding/ means that we should be able to determine the meaning just by looking at the source code without running the program.

An atom-based module system is one way of satisfying those principles.
But a predicate-based module system is more amenable to compilation?

qname_module_name(QualName, Module, Name)

Lexical binding is a consequence of the /principle of least surprise/: do what most users most likely expect.
But can the principle of least surprise clash with the principle of mathematical elegance?
** Designing the module system
*** What is a module, functionally, relationally, and logically?
From functional programming perspective, a module is a function from name to value.

From relational programming perspective, a module is a functional relation between name and value.

From logic programming perspective, a module is a collection of Horn clauses.

Atom-based modules break those intuitions?

Thus in Prolog, if we have first-class relations, then we can have first-class modules.

Having first-class relation means using /second-order logic/.
That is the =M= in this example:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
usefoo :-
    import("foo.pro", mypred, M),
    M(bar).

% But that can be made first-order?

usefoo :-
    import("foo.pro", M),
    M:bar.
#+END_EXAMPLE
*** How does a module differ from dictionary, function, table, map, association?
What can we do with zero module? We can create the empty module.
What can we do with a module?
What can we do with many modules?

Equality vs identity:
Must a programming language separate equality and identity?
Should two strings be equal, if they have different memory addresses but the same content?

Let \( D \) be the programming language's domain of discourse.

Let \( F(D) = D \to D \) be the set of every endofunction whose domain is \( D \).
Let \( D \) be the smallest set such that \( F(D) \subset D \).
Thus \( D \) is the least fixed point of \( F \).

A dictionary can be a finite function whose domain is a finite subset of \( D \).

A module can be modeled as a dictionary.
A module can be modeled as a finite function \( N \to D \) where \( N \) is the set of names for which the module has an entry.
A module can be modeled as an infinite function \( N \to D \) where \( N \) is the set of all possible names.
*** Do not conflate modules and files
A module is the internal representation.
File contains the external representation.
The analogy:
A module contains thoughts.
A file countains writings representing those thoughts.
*** Should module names correspond to file names?
If the relationship between a file and a module does not have to be 1:1,
then complications arise.

We assume 1:1 relationship between files and modules.

Problems:
- M:N mapping between files and modules
- Name clashes
- Module instantiation
- Imports and dependencies
- I want to make many languages and interpreters, and I don't want to prefix each predicate:
  I want to write N interpret predicates, I don't want to write 1 langN_interpret for each N.
- A clashy-named old predicate is used a lot.

Why do we have modules if records suffice?
An OCaml "functor" would then simply be a function from records to records.

OCaml has first-class modules, but can it import a file into a module?
https://v1.realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/first-class-modules.html

OCaml ties module name to file name.
Is this bad?
"Source files in OCaml are tied into the module system, with each file compiling down into a module whose name is derived from the name of the file."
https://v1.realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/files-modules-and-programs.html

What JavaScript does right:
- a module is a plain JavaScript object
- it is possible import a file into a module referred by a local variable
What Ocaml does right:
- local import

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
interpret(Language, Context, Expression, Meaning).
#+END_EXAMPLE

Some solutions that come to mind:
- Load module using gensym/2 if not current_module/2.
  The loader generates the name of the module that the file is loaded to.
  module/2 is anti-pattern.
- name mangling like what C++ does on top of C; generated module names
- Pengines to separate the worlds?
- Logtalk

We want to state these facts:
- This file imports predicate P from file F,
  because a predicate in this file calls/uses/depends-on that predicate P defined in that file F.

We came up with the import/2 directive.

Prolog expansion has some problems.
 [fn::https://blog.logtalk.org/2011/03/a-more-sane-implementation-of-the-term-expansion-mechanism/]

Moura 2003 \cite{pmoura2003logtalk}: "The first time I felt the need for strong encapsulation features in Prolog was during my final year undergraduate project, in 1989."

This SWI-Prolog Google Groups discussion thread[fn::https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/swi-prolog/clash$20module%7Csort:date/swi-prolog/f8LpJN8MYm0/uUYfUmN5AgAJ] is relevant.

Module is about namespacing.

We want to say that "The mypred/3 in file1 is the same as the yourpred/3 in file2."
*** How do we design a module system that subsumes both atom-based and predicate-based module systems?
A module system is a name-prefixing mechanism.

*** Anonymous predicates?
- Do anonymous predicates subsume module systems?
- What may anonymous predicates look like?

It should be possible to talk about a predicate without naming it first.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
p(A) :- A = 0 ; A = 1.

% vs

\ A :- A = 0 ; A = 1.
#+END_EXAMPLE

\( p(x) \equiv x=0 \vee x=1 \) vs \( \lambda x (x=0 \vee x=1) \).

How do we add anonymous relations/predicates to Prolog?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
let p = \ A :- (A = 1 ; A = 2).

p(A) :- A = 1, A = 2.
#+END_EXAMPLE
*** Prolog mixins
A Prolog /mixin/ (mix-in) is simply an include file that adds features to the includer.
Example, this mixin endows the includer with a static vocabulary about objects and properties,
akin to object-orientation without method.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
% object.pro

:- multifile opv/3.

get(O,P,V) :- \+ opv(O,P,V), throw... . % what?
get(O,P,V) :- opv(O,P,V).
#+END_EXAMPLE
*** Component system with socket-plug metaphor
I need a component system for programming in the large.
Prolog module system is a building block, but Prolog modules by themselves are not enough.
Socket-and-plug metaphor fits nicely?
The name tells it all:
a socket is a female connector and a plug is a male connector,
and we connect plugs to sockets,
and Prolog should complain if it sees a socket that is connected not exactly once.

An input is a multifile predicate.

A pin is a Name/Arity term.

A plug exports symbols.

A socket imports symbols.

A module may have multiple plugs and sockets.

Pins are matched by NameArity.
The ordering of pins does not matter.

A Prolog module system is either /predicate-based/ or /atom-based/.
XSB is atom-based.
SWI is predicate-based.
GNU Prolog does not have a module system.
*** No separate header files
Separate header files are remnants of the big-design-up-front era.
** Organizing and loading Prolog source files without name clashes
Prolog multifile predicates can be used for /dependency injection/.
Instead of importing a module, declare a multifile predicate and let the user link that predicate.

Prolog source files come in /two kinds/ depending on how they are loaded: /type-1/ files and /type-2/ (module-free) files.
In short, a type-2 file should not assume that the Prolog implementation has a module system, unless when defining meta-predicates.
The discipline is:
- A type-2 file should not contain any directives except include/1.
  Thus a type-2 file must not begin with module/2 directive, and must not use the use_module/[1,2] directive.
- A type-2 file should not contain hard-coded module references.
  A type-2 file should not contain any qualified M:P call where M is a hard-coded atom;
  it is fine if M is a variable.

There are several mostly incompatible ways to load a Prolog source file:
- include/1, only works as directive
- consult/1
- consult_unregistered/1, which is load_files/2 with register(false) option
- use_module/2
- load_files/2
- consult_unregistered_into_module/2, which is just load_files/2 with module/1 and register(false) options
- Logtalk, logtalk_load/1, logtalk_load/2

The function of the main file is to link the non-main files.
To maximize reusability and minimize name clash,
a non-main file must not contain any hard-coded module names:
Those files must not contain module/2 declarations and use_module/[1,2] directives.

    Is it made for grouping?
    Is grouping only a side-effect?

- A module is a bunch of imports and exports?
- A module is smallest unit of reuse? Isn't that function?
- A module is smallest unit of compilation? Isn't that function?
*** Key idea: Module = Dictionary -> Dictionary
Assume a dependently-typed language.

Recall some terminologies:

- A record is a tuple whose components are named.
- A dictionary is also known as key-value map or look-up table.

Then a module is a lambda abstraction that takes a record and gives a record.

A module is a lambda abstraction.

This idea is similar to Nix and JavaScript modules.

=type Module = Map Name Decl -> Map Name Decl=

A module translates into a lambda-calculus expression.
An import translates to an entry in the input dictionary.
An export translates to an entry in the output dictionary.
Example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    module {
        import add mul Int32;
        export f g T;
        f = add;
        g = mul;
        T = Int32;
    };

    -- The expression above translates to:

    \ {add; mul; Int32; ...} -> {
        f = add;
        g = mul;
        T = Int32;
    };
#+END_EXAMPLE

- Key ideas of that example:

  - Dictionary pattern matching simulates row polymorphism.
  - ={a;b;c;}= is shorthand for ={a:a; b:b; c:c;}=.

** <2019-04-02> The implementation? Draft: A clash-free module system
*** About this draft
The target audience is the SWI-Prolog maintainer, Jan Wielemaker.

I wish to convince Jan that we must have a clash-free module system
so that we do not become the victim of our own success when Prolog becomes mainstream.

I wish to see such module system standardized and implemented.

Where should we publish this to?
- Post in SWI-Prolog Discourse group https://swi-prolog.discourse.group
- Open an issue in SWI-Prolog Roadmap https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/roadmap
*** Message
Dear Prolog implementors,

The Prolog community seems to be growing, and so is the number of SWI-Prolog packs.
As more people write code, name clashes become more likely.
We should standardize a clash-free module system before we have too many users and name clashes become too painful.

There are two ways to avoid name clashes:
- Rely on programmer coordination and discipline.
  For example, the pack authors may prefix their module names by a domain name they control.
  But it would be better for a system to avoid assuming that humans behave well.
- Make name clashes impossible.
  This is the path taken by JavaScript.
  It is the only language I know that does this by its first-class modules.

The key to clash-free module names is simple:
- A file must not contain any module names/references.
- The module/2 directive must ignore its first argument (the module name).
- Dependency must be specified by file paths and not module names.

Both predicate-based and atom-based modules are fine, as long as a module does not name itself,
that is, as long as a file does not expect to be loaded to a module with a certain name.
*** Implementation details
I have a working code for SWI-Prolog in [[https://github.com/edom/work/blob/master/software/boot/load.pro][boot/load.pro]].
It defines an =import/2= directive using =term_expansion/2=.
The loader generates module names.
An example usage looks like this:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:- import("somefile.pl",[
    pred/1
    , run/0 as somefile_run
]).
#+END_EXAMPLE

The presence of an =:- import(Source, Specs)= in a file means that the file requires some things from Source.

Source may be:
- =file(Path)= where =Path= is a relative path to a file.
  This path is resolved against the file that contains the import/2 directive.

Specs is a list of Spec.

Spec may be:
- =Name/Arity=
- =Name/Arity as Alias=
- =multifile(Name/Arity)=: a "reverse-import"
- =multifiles(Preds)= where each Pred is a Name/Arity

Not yet implemented:
importing operators like SWI-Prolog 7.6.4 use_module/2.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
use_module(..., [
    op(_,_,some_operator)
]).
#+END_EXAMPLE

One day someone may make it possible for Source to be =github(...)= or =pack(...)=,
but perhaps we should not do that because it will increase compilation time.

An example language with a clash-free module system is JavaScript.
Even better, modules are first-class in JavaScript.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
function foo () {
    var a = require("file1.js");
    var b = require("file2.js");
    console.log(a.x + b.y);
}

// a.js
export let x = 1;

// b.js
export let y = 2;
#+END_EXAMPLE

What do you think?

Best regards,

Erik
*** Proposal: import_qualified/1 directive
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:- import_qualified(file(RelativePath) as local_module(Name)).
:- import_qualified([
    file(File1) as local_module(Name1),
    file(File2) as local_module(Name2),
    ...
]).
#+END_EXAMPLE

This recursively replaces all module expressions.
*** The problem: We could be a victim of our own success if we don't act
Imagine that there were 10,000 SWI-Prolog packs: There would be naming conflicts.
We can learn from the Haskell community's complaints with Haskell's module system,
and do it right before it becomes too painful.
Let us prepare, so that we do not become a victim of our own success.
*** Criteria of a satisfactory solution
Ideally, many people can write and use libraries without name clashes.
*** Related discourses
- Contributing libraries https://swi-prolog.discourse.group/t/contributing-libraries/381
** Implementing modules
*** Adding module system by term_expansion/2
If a Prolog system has term_expansion/2 but does not have a module system, then we can add a module system.
The idea is to recursively replace each term =A= with =':'(M,A)=.

This makes something similar to XSB Prolog's atom-based module system.
*** Logtalk?
"You can even use [Logtalk] to run Prolog module code in Prolog compilers such as GNU Prolog that don't include a module system."
 [fn::https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6695788/programming-in-the-large-with-prolog]
*** Haskell first-class modules?
Shields & Peyton-Jones 2002 \cite{shields2002first}.
*** Module systems in other languages?
REBOL module system?

Bad example: java:
- name is a property of a method.
- a method cannot be referred to by a name.
If you use reflection, you are referring to a representation of that method, not the method itself.

Bad example: scheme: map, vector-map, tree-map, etc.

** Operators and adaptive grammar
Should operator be module-scoped or global-scoped?

An operator declaration modifies the Prolog parser/reader's grammar in a limited manner.

Is it not confusing if parsing a text can, in the middle of parsing,
change the grammar that is used to parse the text itself?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
% input

:- op(400,yfx,'+').
:- op(500,yfx,'*').

a(A) :- A is 1+2*3.
:- op(500,yfx,'+').
:- op(400,yfx,'*').
b(A) :- A is 1+2*3.

% output

?- a(A).
A = 9.

?- b(A).
A = 7.
#+END_EXAMPLE

If we want adaptive grammars[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_grammar],
why stop at operators?
Should we go at least as far as OMeta?

"Operator precedence parsing is particularly ugly in PEGs, since by default, they don't support left recursion.
The OMeta folks figured out how to cleanly support left recursion in PEGs, but you lose the linear-time guarantee."
 [fn::https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2330830]

If we have local variables, we should also have local operator declarations.
We need an adaptive grammar with scope.

We also need composable grammars
 [fn::https://stackoverflow.com/questions/953185/composable-grammars]

* The problems with Prolog
** Absence of modules, scoping, and local variables
Prolog does not have scopes and local variables.

Is that absence a bad thing?

(old title: Lambda, closure, scoping, higher-order logic programming, relational programming)

One application of higher-order logic programming is scopes (local variables).
It can be done by allowing implications in Horn clause bodies.

Ulrich Neumerkel's "Lambdas in ISO Prolog"[fn::https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/Prolog-inedit/ISO-Hiord.html].

Logtalk 2.38.0 has lambda expressions.[fn::https://blog.logtalk.org/2009/12/lambda-expressions-in-logtalk/]

Why can't it be this?
Isn't "apply" just variable substitution?
But the problem is not substitution.
The problem is /scoping/.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
apply(A^B, A, B).
#+END_EXAMPLE

<2019-04-05>
See lambda.pro.
It does the job, but the variables cannot be reused.

Example of closure:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
let makeGetter list = \ i -> elemAt list i
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can manually do closure conversion (lambda lifting)[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_lifting].

Naish 1996 \cite{naish1996higher} [fn::http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/ulrich/Prolog-inedit/naish.html]:
"First, we point out that call/N is not the way to go,
despite its recent popularity as the primitive to use for higher order logic programming."

Let's try something else.

I propose "local predicate" as the logic-relational analog of the functional lambda expression.

The meaning of the expression =A ^ B= is "prove B assuming that A is true".
The semantics is substitution.

Define the meaning of =A^B= as prove =B= assuming =A=.
Thus, the meaning of =p(1) ^ (p(A), q(B))= is =(A = 1, q(B))=.

Lambda expression is variable scoping.
Prolog needs "knowledge base" scoping.

Each lambda parameter x is encoded as a unary predicate x(A) that succeeds exactly once and unifies A to the value of the variable.

Implication is the logic parallel of lambda abstraction.
Proving is the logic parallel of lambda application.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
lambda application: (x to x + 1) 23
becomes
prolog query: x(23), y(B) --> x(A), B is A+1
#+END_EXAMPLE

But this may be a bad idea, because the predicate x/1 is dynamically scoped.
"Local dynamic clauses"

Assert the antecedent when entering frame.
Retract the antecedent when leaving frame.

Ask at stackoverflow:

Is there a with_assumption_prove_goal/2 predicate in Prolog?

I am looking for "knowledge base scoping" as an analog of variable scoping in lambda expressions.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Assumption = (p(1) ; p(2)),
Goal = (p(A), writeln(A)),
with_assumption_prove_goal(Assumption, Goal)

1
2
#+END_EXAMPLE

It can be done with meta-interpretation.
I think it can also be done with Prolog engines.

Interesting google scholar search: logic with lexical scoping

It may be disconcerting that it takes an academic article to add local variables.
But we are doing it in a principled manner.
We are thinking about how to add local variables to logic, not to a programming language.

Predicate logic is dynamically scoped.
p(G) leftarrow ( x(1) right arrow G)
defines a local dynamic predicate x/1

Currying requires keeping track of the arity of partially-applied functions.
Currying readily generalizes to partially-applied relations.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
f (x,y) -> (f x) y
r (x,y) -> (r x) y
#+END_EXAMPLE

Logic vs relational?

MacLennan 1981 \cite{maclennan1981overview},
MacLennan 1983 \cite{maclennan1983relational}

MacLennan 1981 \cite{maclennan1981introduction}:
A function is a /left-univalent/ relation.
I have been looking for that term.

\(R \wedge S\) in relation is =R, S= in logic.

The connection is fundamental:
Every set \(R\) corresponds to a predicate \(\phi\) in this way: \(\SetBuilder{\vec{x}}{\phi(\vec{x})}\).
We say that the predicate is an /intension/ and the set is an /extension/.

How are Prolog and Lisp similar?
- Both Prolog and Lisp have symbols and cons cells.

- Both have macros.
  - Lisp has defmacro.
  - Prolog has term_expansion/2 and goal_expansion/2.

SQL? Datalog?
** Programming can be thought of as applied mathematics?
Prolog can be approached from logic, database theory, philosophy.

In Prolog, by default, function symbols mean themselves,
and this gives us freedom to write interpreters to interpret function symbols differently.
** Theorem proving
Problem statement of automated theorem proving:
Given a formula G (query, goal), a set of axioms A, and a set of inference rules R, prove G.

A formula can be represented by a Prolog term.

An inference rule transforms a formula into another formula having the same truth value.

It may be better to write a theorem prover in Prolog than to use Prolog directly as theorem prover.

Prolog can be used as a theorem prover.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
p.
q :- p.

?- q.
true.
#+END_EXAMPLE

It is simple to write a theorem prover for propositional logic.
But how about first-order logic?

What is resolution[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(logic)]?
Why is it widely used in automatic theorem proving?

Aren't theorem provers just constrained rewriting systems?

Harel 2008 \cite{harel2008can} has a lovely ambition.
But I'm afraid I see only two way to realize that ambition:
either invent a human-level AI that can write software, or invent a machine that can do telepathy.
But I believe that we will someday have at least one of that.

I want a browser like this.
Each user should have total control of what runs on his/her machine.
I should be able to tell my browser how to modify the CSS and JavaScript for certain websites.
From \cite{harel2008can}:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[...] conveniently remove pieces of behavior that we donâ€™t like and replace them with others [...]
I would love to be able to reprogram the interactions that the web-based systems I work with force me to followâ€”not to mention reprogramming my annoying and unnecessarily complicated DVD.
I canâ€™t change the way Amazon or B&H respond to what I do, for example, but I can surely change everything that has to do with the way my browser and my computer deal with these websites.
And how better to do that than by simply canceling some pieces of interactive behavior and playing in new ones, using the very interface on which we interact, subject, of course, to my inability to change their behavior?
#+END_QUOTE

Assert accepts a clause.

* Extending Prolog
** First order logic already has local variable scoping and local assertion
Scoping existential quantified.

Local assertion is implication.

We need more than Horn clauses.
** Logical implication is local variable scoping
I have an example in =scope.pro=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
fun :- (locvar(1) => locvar(A), format("locvar is ~w~n",[A]), nl).
#+END_EXAMPLE

The logical semantics of ~A => B~ is "B is provable, if A is assumed to be true".

The operational semantics of ~A => B~ is:
1. Assert A.
2. Call B.
3. Retract A.

Problem:
How do we "undefine" a local variable?

For example: In ~A => B, (not(A) => C)~,
we want A to be defined in B but undefined in C.

Why should we prefer monotonic logic?
* Program checking
Motivation:
We want two avoid stupid runtime mistakes
that can be prevented before runtime (at "compile" time).

The problem:
Given a Prolog term T, determine whether =call(T)= will throw a type error.
Note that T may be a conjunction of goals.

I'm thinking about using abstract interpretation or partial deduction.

Program checking is partial deduction.

This program is a mistake.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
p(0).
mistake1 :- p(foo).
mistake2 :- number_string(_,_).
#+END_EXAMPLE

We can imagine a =check_goal/1= predicate.

The key idea is to unify a variable with its type.
** The errors Prolog programmers make
The errors made by a Prolog programmer include:
- type error: instantiating an input argument to a term of a wrong type
- mode error: not instantiating an input argument
- termination error: infinite loop, left recursion

In this example, the first argument of interpret is n/1 or a +/1.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
interpret(n(A),A).
interpret(A+B,C) :- C is A+B.
#+END_EXAMPLE

A call such as =interpret(1-2,A)= should raise an exception instead of failing.
** Typed first-order logic
Another name for typed logic is many-sorted logic.[fn::http://www.cs.miami.edu/home/geoff/Courses/CSC749-17F/Content/Typed1stOrder.shtml]

Typing relation relates symbol to type (Cartesian product of sets)
Example: \( T(p^2, Integer \times String) \).
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
type(p/2, relation([integer,string])).
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Vanilla Prolog type-checking
Suppose that we have a predicate =p/1= that expects an integer or a var.
We can type-check it like this:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
% public
:- export(cp/1).
cp(A) :-
    check_or_throw(p(A),before),
    p(A),
    check_or_throw(p(A),after).

% private
p(0).
p(1).

check(p(A),before) :- integer(A).
check(p(A),before) :- var(A).

check(p(A),after) :- integer(A).

check_or_throw(A,T) :- check(A,T), !.
check_or_throw(A,T) :- throw(error(check_failed(A,T),_)).

The advantage is that it is vanilla Prolog.
No domain-specific type-specification languages.

The disadvantage is that it is often done unnecessarily.
** Type-checking interpreter
One step further than that is to make a checking interpreter.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cp(A) :- interpret(p(A)).

interpret(G) :- check(G,before), call(G), check(G,after).
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Abstract interpretation
The semantics is:
If the check succeeds, then the goal will not fail due to stupid type error.

Unsatisfiability is not a type error.
For example, the following =q/1= is /unsatisfiable/, but it does not throw a type error.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
p(0).

q(A) :- p(A), A = 1.
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Problem: the type of variables
We mean the type of the term bound to the variable.
Attributed variables are suitable for this scenario.
But not all Prolog implementations have attributed variables.
So we use gensym?

Type-checking variables would be easier if Prolog variables were explicitly quantified.
** Problem: non-terminating predicates
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
check(p(A,B),before) :- integer(A).
check(p(A,B),after) :- string(B).

p(A,B) :- p(A,B).
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Checking when unchecked code calls checked code
** Manual checking
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
interpret(A,_) :- var(A), !, instantiation_error(A).
interpret(A,_) :- \+exp(A), !, type_error(exp,A).
interpret(n(A),Z) :- !, Z=A.
interpret(A+B,Z) :- !, Z is A+B.
interpret(A*B,Z) :- !, Z is A*B.

exp(n(_)).
exp(_+_).
exp(_*_).
#+END_EXAMPLE
* Sometimes we want function and determinism
Sometimes we really want to write a function and not a general relation.
The sign of such unfilfilled desire is:
Each clause begins with pattern-matching and cut,
as in this example:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
interpret(n(A),Z) :- !, Z=A.
interpret(A+B,Z) :- !, interpret(A,A0), interpret(B,B0), Z is A0+B0.
interpret(A*B,Z) :- !, interpret(A,A0), interpret(B,B0), Z is A0*B0.
#+END_EXAMPLE

It would be nice if we could write it in a functional style like this
which might then be rewritten with =term_expansion/2=:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:- function interpret(E) = case(E,[
    n(A) -> A
    , A+B -> interpret(A) + interpret(B)
    , A*B -> interpret(A) * interpret(B)
]).
#+END_EXAMPLE
* Prolog implementation
** How would we implement Prolog in C?
I am thinking of these:
- struct Prolog_interpreter
- struct Prolog_term

But there are no integers in logic;
there are only logical symbols and non-logical symbols.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
// .h

struct Prolog_term_;
typedef struct Prolog_term_ Prolog_term;

bool prolog_term_as_int (const Prolog_term*, int*);
bool prolog_term_as_strz (const Prolog_term*, size_t, char*);

// .c

struct Prolog_interpreter {
    Prolog_term* clauses;
    size_t cap;
};

enum Prolog_term_type {
    Prolog_integer = 0, // but there are no integers in logic?
    Prolog_string = 1,
    Prolog_atom = 2,
    Prolog_functor = 3,
    Prolog_var = 4,
    Prolog_foreign_object = 5,
};

struct Prolog_term_ {
    Prolog_term_type type;
};

struct Prolog_string {
    Prolog_term_ term;
    size_t num_bytes;
    char* bytes;
};

struct Prolog_atom {
    Prolog_term_ term;
    int id;
    Prolog_string* string;
};

struct Prolog_functor {
    Prolog_term_ term;
    Prolog_atom name;
    size_t arity;
    Prolog_term* args;
};

struct Prolog_var {
    Prolog_term_ term;
    Prolog_term* value; // NULL if unbound
};

bool prolog_unify (Prolog_term* a, Prolog_term* b) {
    // ???
}

How does SWI-Prolog implement Prolog in C?

SWI-Prolog has the macros =PL_succeed= and =PL_fail=.
** Why does SWI-Prolog use Git submodules instead of a mono-repo?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Submodules have had their value in the past when several of the modules were practically managed by other people.
At the moment all package modules are practically in maintenance stage and this doesnâ€™t matter too much, but I still like to be able to do so.
Submodules were also intended to be shared with other Prolog systems.
That too isnâ€™t active right now, but work is going on between XSB and SWI, so who knows?
#+END_QUOTE

XSB Prolog source code is in a Subversion repository.

Reading "Subversion Design"[fn::https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/notes/subversion-design.html] helps us understand SVN.
- Subversion can track an empty directory. Git cannot.
- Both SVN

  and Git have problems with merge conflicts that involve renames.
** How to contribute to SWI-Prolog?
*** How to clone the Git repository?
<2019-04-06>
SubmitPatch.html[fn::http://www.swi-prolog.org/howto/SubmitPatch.html] is a little messy.
See unix.html[fn::http://www.swi-prolog.org/build/unix.html] about git submodules.
See also Discourse[fn::https://swi-prolog.discourse.group/t/being-friendly-to-quick-contributions/493/3].

It is not a simple git-clone, because we are using submodules.
** Foreign language interface
SWI-Prolog has a foreign language interface[fn::http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=foreign], but I demand more.

I want to call C code from Prolog without writing a C wrapper.
I want Prolog to marshal the arguments and unmarshal the return values.

Even more,
I want to write low-level code /directly in Prolog/.
A solution already exists:
SWI-Prolog pack "ffi": [fn::http://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list?p=ffi]
- "This package deals with calling C functions from shared objects (DLLs) from Prolog without writing wrappers"
- It parses C header files and C source files!

I want to write C code in Prolog.
I want to have C with type inference and other cool features in Prolog.

I dream of writing foreign code directly in Prolog.
I dream of a Prolog code that can output an amd64 ELF binary.

There are two problems:
emitting machine code, and executing machine code.

Options for emitting machine code:
- Design a DSL like ASN.1 to describe binary layout such as C struct or Pascal record.
  I have a sketch in database_internal_dcg.pro.
- Design an language that can be represented in Prolog and translated to C.
- Reuse LLVM.
- Building something like LLVM.
  Write our own intermediate representation.
  Static-single-assignment three-address code.
- Write amd64 machine code directly.
  This is bad.
  Too tightly coupled.
  We will want to generate i386, arm, and jvm machine codes.

Options for executing machine code:
- Write machine code to some memory area, set PROT_EXEC with mprotect, and call the address.
- Write an ELF SO object and use dlopen.

The skeleton of the minimum viable product:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
example :-
    compile(ret, ByteCode),
    write_bytes(ByteCode).

nb_write_address(+Address, -Thing)
#+END_EXAMPLE
** What is a Unicode character?
This question is tricky.

Does a character correspond to a code point?

What about accents, ligatures, etc.?

Is an accent by itself a character?

Is a hanzi radical a character?

Is a hanzi a character?

How many bytes are in a character?

What are equivalent characters?
What is Unicode normalization?[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence]
** The problem with dynamic database
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
do_something :-
    assert(a), ...
#+END_EXAMPLE
Dynamic database is like global variable.
There can only be one instance of =do_something= running without confusing the dynamic database.

But we can replace each occurence of =assert(A)=
with =assert(local(G,A))= where G is generated by =gensym/2=.
This is like rewriting C global variables into structs.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
int x;
int f () {
    return x;
}

// becomes

struct global {
    int x;
};

int f (struct global* g) {
    return g->x;
}

* SWI-Prolog packs
I want to use a pack.
I want to know:
- How do I install a pack the easy way?
  Use =pack_install/1=.
- How do I install a pack manually outside SWI-Prolog without =pack_install/1=?
- How do I install a specific version of a pack?
- How do I freeze my dependencies to avoid silent breakage?
- How do I use multiple versions of a pack?
  My program depends on A and B.
  A depends on C version 1.
  B depends on C version 2.
  It seems the packs must be updated.
- To what directory are packs installed?
  =pack_install/1= will prompt you where to install.
* What I like about Prolog and Lisp
I can see the source code of everything as long as it is loaded and is non-foreign.
Prolog has =listing/1= and =edit/1= and =help/1=.
Emacs has =M-x find-function=[fn::https://emacsredux.com/blog/2014/06/18/quickly-find-emacs-lisp-sources/]
and =C-h f= or =M-x describe-function=.
SBCL has =describe=.[fn::https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33707068/how-can-i-view-the-definition-of-a-function-in-lisp-sbcl]

We can think of Prolog as Lisp with M-expression instead of S-expression.
* Namespacing atoms
When we write a predicate that deconstructs an instance of an algebraic data type, we don't want the constructors to be namespaced.

When we use an atom as a name under the unique name assumption, in a multifile predicate, sometimes we want the atom to be namespaced.
* Parsing Prolog?
Prolog's grammar is /adaptive/[fn::https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/adapt/top.html]:
the =op/3= directive changes the grammar.
