- Where is tutorial?
- A goal should be to make it easy to make correct software?
- 2014, slides, "How I became interested in foundations of mathematics.", Vladimir Voevodsky, [pdf](https://www.math.ias.edu/vladimir/sites/math.ias.edu.vladimir/files/2014_08_ASC_lecture.pdf)
- Why should we be interested in homotopy type theory?
- [Coq]({% link coq.md %})
- [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/)
    - Pros of Lean
        - Integrates with Visual Studio Code
    - Cons of Lean
        - Less mature than Coq
- Should we care about the relationship between functional programming and theorem proving?
- Ramble
    - Useless idea?
        - Reverse-proving: generate all proofs of a theory.
        (Proving is: given a statement, prove (or disprove).)
            - Which true sentences are interesting?
            - Which proofs are interesting?
- Companies
    - [Galois](https://galois.com/), on [github](https://github.com/GaloisInc/)
