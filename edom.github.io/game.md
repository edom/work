- What should games do?
    - Game should train the brain.
    - Game should teach [transferable skill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transferable_skill).
- What do you know about yourself?
    - My Steam data says that a game usually bores me after 20 hours.
- Why play games?
    - It's fun.
- Why not play games?
    - It wastes time.
    - My older self just feels less fun from playing games.
- How do we make good games?
    - The best game isn't the one with the best graphics.
    - The challenge is how to get the player immersed with minimal resources.
    - All games eventually bore the player.
    - Hypothesis: The only reason a player stays is that the player
    resonates with the alternate identity built by the game.
    - Hypothesis: the games you pick reflect who you want to be.
    - Some games are even useful.
        - Serious games.
        - [Wikipedia: Human-based computation game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-based_computation_game), game with a purpose
- Games I have played:
    - Factorio:
        - The game is practically over when you have 50 laser turrets.
        - I'm bored after 72 hours into the game.
        This is excellent.
        Usually I'm bored after about 20 hours.
    - SimCity 4
    - City: Skylines
        - I uninstalled it to free disk space.
    - Endless sky
        - The game is practically over when you can build 50 haulers;
        you can kill anything as long as your fleet gathers around you.
        - It's free and open-source.
    - Prison architect
        - Get 200 low risk prisoners into a holding cell or dorm,
        build several parole rooms,
        and profit a lot.
    - Battle of Wesnoth
    - Freeciv, call to power
    - Freecol, colonization
    - Romance of the three kingdoms
    - SimCity 4, LinCity NG
    - Constructor, mob rule
    - Red alert
    - Sim Tower
    - Axis and allies, TripleA
    - Simutrans, transport tycoon
        - But I hate the GUI.
    - Liquid war
    - Grand theft auto: Vice city
    - Board games
        - Abstract strategy board games
            - Chess
            - Wéiqí, go, baduk
            - No point playing abstract strategy board games anymore. AI has beaten humans. Find something else.
    - Endgame: singularity
        - The game is pretty much over as soon as you have quantum computers.
- Other interesting games I don't play
    - Metal gear solid
        - MGS 3 snake eater has the best stories
        - MGS 4 is more like a movie than a game
        - MGS 5 the phantom pain is that way because Konami understandably chooses money over Kojima
            - Konami is a company
                - Every company is for-profit, or dies
                    - but they cut out 1 chapter from MGS 5
    - The *Yakuza* series
        - dark comedy, very good story writing
        - should ring a bell for Kitano Takeshi (Beat Takeshi) fans
    - I was thinking about buying "Kerbal Space Program", but now I'm sure that I'm not buying it.
