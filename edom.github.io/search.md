        - Problems
            - Google should rank down Pinterest.
                - In my experience, Pinterest is never an authoritative nor original source.
                - Google has ranked down Tumblr and Wikipedia.
            - Example of Google censorship (compare with DuckDuckGo):
                - search terms related to pornography
                - search terms related to the darknet (the hidden wiki, Tor websites)
                - rhino poaching (Google favors contents against rhino poaching)

- The Internet is full of crap.
    - So are libraries.
    - So is the world.
    - So is this website.
    - Thus, you must think for yourself.
