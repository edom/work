#+TITLE: Get rich quickly without going to jail

#+OPTIONS: ^:nil toc:nil
Here we want to increase income without increasing operations.
Find a business that scales with low maintenance burden.
We want to own systems that can run without ourselves.
The ideal amount of operating expenses is zero.

How quickly?
About 10 years?
We can always speed it up by financial leverage (debt, credit),
but leverage also multiplies the risk.

What?

Make capitalism work for us instead of making us work for capitalism.

Maximize long-term profit: maximize income, minimize expenses.

Business without employees[fn::https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/249868]

Find better use for the idly deposited moneys at the banks.

"Most startups should be deer hunters"[fn::https://bothsidesofthetable.com/most-startups-should-be-deer-hunters-7fdecf58f4f6]:
Know which customers you want to serve.
Target the customers whose sizes are similar to your company.

This page aims to answer "What is the most productive use of my time?"
where productivity is defined economically as output (profit potential) per input (labor + capital).
* Find out the most productive use of my time
For each business activity plan:
- Compute the expected net present value.
  - Assume a perpetuity.
  - Guess the probability of success.
  - Guess the yearly profit if success.

If I work hard, I am sure that I can raise my salary by IDR 5,000,000 every 6 months.
Can I do better?
Should I start my own company?
* How do we reduce the mortality rate of startups?
* Why do startups die?
Does this USA statistics[fn::https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/03/startup-statistics-small-business.html]
also hold for Indonesia?
* Extract wealth from society by seeking rent
There are still rooms for rent seekers[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking].

If everyone seeks rent, nobody works, and everyone dies.

If some people seek rent, then those rent seekers will be disproportionately enriched.

Here we are trying to use the law to get paid for simply owning something and doing not much else.

The financial markets have ample room for wealth extraction.
** Own a property
Buy a property, contract a management agency, and lease the property.
** Buy a REIT (real-estate investment trust) / property-backed ETF
<2019-04-24>
Indonesia has no REIT.
Indonesia is at least 10 years behind the USA.
** Find good properties
Determine what is good.
- Why do people stay at hotels? Attending events. Meetings. Inspections. A combination of closeness to the actual location of interest and the hotel's reputation. People stay at a hotel not because they admire the hotel building, but because they care about the location.
- Unmarried white-collar workers choose the cheaper between renting and commuting.
- Nomads who change work location every a few years, and people without enough money to buy houses

Determine why people pay:
- The only reason people pay you is that they believe you will give them what they want.
** Buy properties whose owners are in distress
** Crowd-funding
- Vestifarm[fn::https://vestifarm.com/]: crowd-funding to micro-agribusinesses,
  with a return of up to 18% per 4 month (as advertised on <2019-04-22>)
** Practice usury, lend money with interest, crowd-lending
I'm thinking about putting my money in these usurious fintech businesses?
(Are these crowd-lending or crowd-funding?
Crowd-funding is not usurious.)
- Akseleran[fn::https://www.akseleran.com/]: about 18% per year (as advertised <2019-04-24>)
- Artawana[fn::https://www.artawana.com/] (website was down on <2019-04-24>)
- Avantee[fn::https://avantee.co.id]
- Amartha[fn::https://amartha.com/id_ID/]
- Investree[fn::https://www.investree.id/]

That seems better than the stock market's average return of 15% per year.

But we have to be cautious, lest our own greed brings us to a loss greater than the promised gain.
*** Own a bank with zero employees, without physical presence, without customer support
So that we can make our own money,
charge interests, take some wealth from borrowers, with little hassle.

- Everyday there are stocks that rise by 20% and there are stocks that fall by 20%.
  - If we can predict which will rise, we can get rich quickly.
  - Why do prices rise?
    Because buyers concede to sellers.

      - In an economic crisis, tax the wealthy and pay the poor.
      - I think that is an optimal solution (if not the only solution), but that is politically incorrect, so we'll never see that.
    - If ignored, economic crisis will escalate to sociopolitical crisis.
- Banks lend money with interest.

*** Make a business plan
So that we don't fail for stupid reasons.
**** What are we going to do/make/sell?
We should sell something that satisfies two criteria:
- We enjoy designing, making, and operating that thing.
- We have buyers for that thing.

There are too many ways to get rich.

We can flip companies.
We can do active investing.
- Buy a company that is in shambles, fix it, refurbish it, clean it up, and sell it, hopefully for a profit.
- Help dying companies in exchange for partial ownership.

Some other business ideas:
- SME (small and medium enterprise) strategic-thinking consultant
**** To whom do we sell it? Who is going to buy it? How many buyers?
**** How will our buyers know us? Where and how do we find them?
*** Incorporate
[[file:usaha.html][Jalankan usaha]].
*** Basic definitions
Company
Enterprise
Business
Corporation
*** Network?
*** Create wealth?
*** Move?
Move to Scandinavia?[fn::Does this article make sense? http://evonomics.com/where-in-the-world-is-it-easiest-to-get-rich/]
But the climate is harsh?

Move outside Jakarta?
But what opportunities?
*** Have a high-income skill
Examples:
thinking, planning, and software engineering.

** Reduce expenses
*** Minimize operational/administrative/bureaucratic/red-tape hassle
Avoid dealing with labor laws; use contractors, freelancers, etc.

Can we operate a company with no employees?
 [fn::https://www.quora.com/Could-you-operate-a-company-with-no-employees-only-contractors]

 [fn::https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2018/07/26/build-million-dollar-business-with-no-employees/#c4079af270f6]

Contractors do not mean fire-at-will.
Ideally a business relationship improves as time goes by.
*** Minimize tax
**** Maximize non-taxable income
**** Minimize taxable income
- Maximize asset without mark-to-market
- Minimize profit
**** Maximize tax deductions
**** Plant anti-taxation people in the government
*** Write an enterprise operation system in Prolog
- Write an accountant in Prolog
** Build human resource
- Educate software engineers to a comparable quality but faster than the 16 years of formal education
  - Make all Indonesian people understand English,
    because most relevant resources on the Internet are in English
*** Have as many powerful descendants as possible
We can think of our family as cheap loyal labor.

In 2019 it costs Rp 150,000/day to decently feed a person in Jakarta.

What is the ROI (return-on-investment) of a child?

In agricultural societies, more children means more labor, and more labor means more wealth.

This is not true in knowledge societies such as cities.
**** Impregnate as many women with good genetics as possible
Without going to jail, of course.

How many women did Genghis Khan impregnate?
 [fn::https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-456789/Genghis-Khan-The-daddy-lovers.html]

 [fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_with_the_most_children]

With sperm bank, artificial insemination, in-vitro fertilization,
and other reproductive technologies, we can be even more prolific than Genghis Khan.

We may want to do such thing in the 21st century
without the 13rd century plunder, rampage, and rape.

** Make more things doable without going to jail
*** Reduce the ability of government to jail people
**** Downsize the government, relax the laws
Put anti-regulation people in the government;
laissez-faire liberals;
anarcho-capitalists;
unwitting opinionated idealistic hard-liners;
"confused and misguided sympathizers"[fn::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot].
** Understand economics deeper?
*** Economics and antinatalism?
  - Increasing the wealth of the human race conflicts with antinatalism?
  - Increasing the minimum/average wealth of the human race doesn't conflict with antinatalism?
*** Initial money supply
- How is money distributed for the first time (when there is not yet any money)?
- How do we transition from barter to cash?
  - How do we set prices?
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Monetary_Theory][WP:Modern monetary theory]]?
*** Tax
  - Tax enables government to redistribute money (and therefore some wealth).
  - Tax enables government to discourage the consumption of certain goods.
  - Taxation is legalized robbery.
    - The government forcibly takes some of the people's money.
    - The people doesn't get to decide what the tax money is used for.
      - The government is assumed to use that money for the people's good.
*** What?
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics][WP:Trickle-down economics]]

  - How does one arrive at this? How does one think? What is the argument?

- If the total amount of money is constant,
  then the only way for you to have more money
  is to make someone else has less money.

  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism][WP:Mercantilism]] assumes that the total wealth in the world is constant?

    - "Mercantilists viewed the economic system as a zero-sum game, in which any gain by one party required a loss by another.[16]"

- Questions I haven't been able to answer

  - If everybody needs to buy food, then why aren't farmers the richest people on Earth?

    - What if the farmers don't spend?

      - Will money collect at the farmers?
      - Will they be the richest people on Earth?

- Money circulation

  - Circulating money amount should be proportional to amount of goods/services exchanged?
  - The amount of money in circulation can be reduced by tax or destruction.
  - Why do governments sell bonds?

    - To reduce the amount of money in circulation now?

      - At the cost of increasing a bigger amount of money circulating in the future?

  - Money moves faster in certain areas?
  - How does the government increases the amount of money in circulation?

    - How I think it might be done:

      - Create new money.
      - Spend that money by buying things from a few elites,

        - with the hope that the elites will quickly spend that money to the lesser elites.

          - Thus that money will circulate to more people.

            - But isn't this trickle-down economics?

    - But does it even do this? Isn't it the banks?

  - What is the effect of people's borrowing from banks?

    - Increase circulating money now (boom part of boom-bust cycle).
    - Reduce /more/ circulating money later (bust part of boom-bust cycle, when the loan is paid back with interest).

      - Principal plus interest (money retired) is greater than principal (money created),
        so the net effect of lending money now
        is a delayed reduction of a greater amount of money in circulation.

        - Where does the money to pay the interest come from?

          - If left alone, eventually the money collects at the banks?

            - But banks have expenses too.

              - Banks need to pay taxes, pay their utility bills,
                pay their staffs.

            - But shouldn't the money collect at the farmers?

  - The ideal inflation rate is zero?

    - But social loafing? Bigger team mean less work per person?
    - Companies exist.

      - It shows that owning a company can be profitable.

- The job of a company (a company director?) is to find what to do and find who should do it.
  - Everyone has different tendencies, strengths, weaknesses, desires, preferences, habits, upbringings, backgrounds.
  - Some people are more suited for some jobs.

    - Do you hire people first, and then formulate jobs suitable for them?
  - A good company accomplishes more than each employee can accomplish individually.

  - Corporates were invented by aristocrats to make sure peasants stay peasants?
  - [[https://bigthink.com/videos/douglas-rushkoff-on-the-internet-and-the-future-of-business][transcript]]
    - We should verify and distill these texts.
      These are some bold claims.
      - "As the peasants became wealthy the aristocracy got scared, who are these people?
        They're not going to be dependent on us any more.
        So they came up with two main financial innovations to prevent the rise of this peer to peer economy.
        The first one was the chartered monopoly, really the parent to the modern corporation.
        All the chartered monopoly was was a way to say all of you small businesses are now illegal.
        If you want to be in the shoe business you have to work for his majesty's royal shoe company.
        You want to be in the grain business you have to work for his majesty's royal grain company.
        So people who were small business people now became employees.
        Instead of selling the value they created, now they sold their time as servants, as wage laborers."
      - "The second invention they came up with was central currency.
        Not such a terrible thing in itself.
        It's great to have a long distance currency that lots of people can use and value, but the problem was they made all of the local currencies illegal.
        So the only way people could trade with each other, the candlestick maker could trade with the chicken farmer was by borrowing central currency from the treasury.
        So now you had to borrow money at interest just in order to transact.
        And that set in motion really a growth cascade.
        If you have a currency that has to be paid back with interest, in order to just make end meet you need an economy that's growing.
        You need more money next year than there was this year."
      - "So that worked well for colonial powers, as long as we could extend into Africa and South America and North America, find slaves, find new resources, we could grow.
        But what happens when you reach the end of the planet's growth as we did really at the end of World War II?"

- Work-life balance?
  - Don't confuse being busy and working.
    - Work should create value.
    - You can feel busy while not producing anything.
    - Work has goals. Being busy doesn't have goals.
  - People don't care about processes.
    They only care about results.
  - If you are not working in all your waking hours, then it's not the work you want.
  - If I could work in my sleep, I would!
- Transport is waste.
  Hence travel is waste.
- Why can't people stay at home on holidays?
  - If you don't like staying at home on holidays, that means something is wrong with your home.
    Fix it.
    Make it the best place on Earth.
    Face reality.
    Don't escape.

- Communism
  - The USSR was beyond communism; it was Stalinism.
  - Stalinism failed because it overcentralizes power.
    - Power corrupts.
    - Oppression isn't a good long-term strategy.
    - People are like gas.
      - Increasing pressure (oppression, stress, overcrowding) increases temperature (collisions, friction, conflicts, clashes).
  - People would still work even if they couldn't get rich.
    - People work to give their life meaning, not to get rich.
      - Getting rich is a side-effect.
    - Would they work better if they could get rich?
- If you buy land and let it idle, only to sell it higher in the future, then you're /seeking rent/.
  - You are not creating any value.
    You burden society.
    You get rich by burdening others, making them poorer.
    The world is better without you.
    You contribute to city sprawl, which causes winding roads, more fuel consumption, more traffic, more pollution, and more heat.
    You should be heavily taxed for the huge negative externality you cause.
- Is all speculation rent-seeking?

"two-loop economy": real economy and financial economy

Interest can be repaid if the lender spends that interest back into the real economy.
