## Monty Hall problem

There are three doors.
Let the set of doors be <span>\( D = \{ 1, 2, 3 \} \)</span>.
One door \\( p \\) has the prize.
The other two doors \\( q, r \\) have nothing.

The host knows which is which. The contestant doesn't.

The host asks the contestant to pick a door.

The contestant chooses a door \\( c \\).

The host opens another door \\( e \\) (empty) that is neither \\( c \\) (your choice) nor \\( p \\) (the prize).
Formally, <span>\( e \in D - \{ c, p \} \)</span>.
Remember that sets don't care how many times an element occurs: <span>\( \{ a,a \} = \{ a \} \)</span>.

The host asks the contestant whether he wants to switch (to the door that is neither \\( c \\) nor \\( e \\)).

Should the contestant switch?

Yes.

A calculation is in [WP: Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem).
