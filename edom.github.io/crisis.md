## Disclaimer

This is my opinion.

## Are you really having a crisis?

### Make sure you're well-nourished.

Malnutrition can worsen mood.

Eat fruit, vegetable, and meat, if they don't make you sick.
Avoid too much processed food.
Avoid sugar.
Avoid flour.
Avoid burnt food.
Avoid sauces and condiments bought from supermarket.
Always read ingredients and nutrition facts.
If you want to snack, eat fruit, vegetable, or meat.
Eat whenever you want to eat, as long as the food is healthy.

You know you eat something with too much sugar if, an hour after eating it, your mouth tastes sour and smells bad.
That's the smell of sugar-eating bacteria party.

Appreciate hunger.
Learn to love being slightly hungry.
Eat attentively.
Taste every inch of the food.
Remember the flavor of the first bite.
Observe that the second bite tastes less.
Observe that the next bites tastes even less.
If you can't taste it, it means you have enough.

The first bite is joy.
Then it's okay.
Then it's unpleasant.
Then you'd rather eat something else.

If you want to always feel the joy of the first bite:
eat the first bite, rinse/gargle your mouth with water, rest your mouth until it tastes neutral, and then eat the next bite, and repeat.

Attentiveness can also help you quit smoking.
Smoke attentively.
Taste everything.
Taste the bitterness.
Think: do you really enjoy it?
People continue to smoke because they have learned to ignore the bad taste.
Normal people doesn't spontaneously seek to smoke because smoking tastes bad.
It's bitter.
It irritates the throat.
Why the hell would anyone like to choke and cough?

### Exercise.

Exercise affects mood.
Exercise affects the brain.

You don't care about weight.
You want to gain muscle.
You want strength and flexibility.

Think like a kid who can't stop moving.
Simply will yourself to move.
Think that you love to move.
You can't stop moving.
You just want to move.
Squat.

### If you're depressed, consult a health professional.

If you have depression, especially if you have depression running in your family, consult a health professional.

Matter affects mind.
Medication changes mood.

## What is the meaning of life? Wrong question.

What do you want to do?

How do you justify your life?
How do others justify your life?
How do you justify others' lives?

Work simply means useful act.
It isn't about employment in a company.

Work justifies its author.
A deed justifies its doer.
(To justify is to give a reason for existence.)

Work-life balance is self-defeating.
Work justifies life.
Life is work.
If your work is not your life, you should find another work.
If you don't know what you want to do in your whole life, you're letting others waste your life.

After one copes with nihilism, there are only two outcomes: actualization (optimistic nihilism) or suicide (pessimistic nihilism).

## Feeling is required.

Solving the crisis requires feeling.
Thinking without feeling worsens the crisis.

Why work?
Because not working feels weird.
Try not working for one year.
I did.
At first, it felt liberating.
After a month, it felt boring.
My mistake was that I quit my job emotionally without knowing what to do next.
The only right reason to quit your job is that you have something you absolutely surely want to accomplish in the rest of your life.
Fleeing from your boss is not an accomplishment.
