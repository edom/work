- Proper walking increases mood.
- Hypothesis:
proper walking minimizes the sum of
the magnitudes of the [jerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_%28physics%29)s of all joints.
- If your walk is noisy, you're jerking your joints.
- Things to do:
    - land with the ball of the feet
    - fix the anterior pelvic tilt
    - focus on pushing the back foot, not on pulling the front foot
