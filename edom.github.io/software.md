## Abandoned software

I started these things but I didn't put enough effort into them.
They might not be what they claim to be.

[Pragmatic Haskell library](https://github.com/edom/pragmatic)
tries to standardize the ways of doing things.

[Try Phabricator](https://github.com/edom/try-phabricator)
uses Docker Compose and is bundled with Apache, PHP, and MariaDB.
It worked out of the box, but it was not designed for production.

[APT manual mirror](https://github.com/edom/apt-manual-mirror) copies selected Debian packages
into local directory while preserving the layout.
It allows you to mirror only the packages you want.

[Haji](https://github.com/edom/haji) tries to be a Java bytecode interpreter written in Haskell.
