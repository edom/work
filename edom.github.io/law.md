## The ideal law enforcement

- Describe the case to a computer (such as a Prolog program).
- The computer suggests relevant laws.
The judge still makes the final decision though.
The judge uses restorative justice.

## what

- There is something above the law: violence, that is, power, that is, human nature.
    - Law is whatever people fear.
    - Power is the ability to do violence (bodily harm).
    - Weapon is power multiplier.
    Weapon multiplies the ability to do violence.
    - People who are above the law are above the law because they have more power than the police.
    Example of those people are extremely rich people, including big corruptors.
    Such powerful people have enough money to do more violence than the police can do.
    - Religious demonstrators are above the law because they can do more violence than the police can do.
        - The police must develop non-lethal crowd-control weapons.
- Law requires the ability to do violence.
- Law isn't about truth.
Law has never been about truth.
Philosophy is about truth.
- Modern law is about *provability*.
    - Since when? Since "habeas corpus"?
        - [WP:Habeas corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus)
    - Is law a formal system that can do arithmetic?
        - What are the consequences of GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems to law?
            - There are true but unprovable things?
    - Is testimony acceptable?
    - [WP:Prima facie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie)
    - [WP:Legal burden of proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)), onus probandi
        - "In a legal dispute, one party is initially presumed to be correct and gets the benefit of the doubt,
        while the other side bears the burden of proof."
        - "When a party bearing the burden of proof meets its burden, the burden of proof switches to the other side."
    - It is better to wrongly acquit than to wrongly convict?
        - [It's better that 10 guilty men go free than one innocent man be wrongly convicted](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/its-better-that-10-guilty-men-go-free-than-one-innocent-man-be-wrongly-convicted-944059.html)

    - [WP:Proof theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_theory)
    - [WP:Provability logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provability_logic)
- Enforceability is important.
An unenforceable law practically doesn't exist.
    - This is why government requires the employer to withhold employee income tax.
    This is why the employee doesn't pay the income tax directly.
        - There are much fewer employees than employees.
        - It's easier to arrest employers than employees.
