\index{binary operation}%
The type of a \emph{binary operation} is \(a \to b \to c\).
\index{binary operation!closed}%
\index{closed binary operation}%
The type of a \emph{closed binary operation} is \(a \to a \to a\).
A binary operation \(\cdot\) is \emph{associative} iff \(x\cdot(y\cdot z) = (x\cdot y)\cdot z\).

\index{magma}%
A \emph{magma} is a set and a closed binary operation.
\index{semigroup}%
A \emph{semigroup} is an associative magma (a magma whose operation is associative).
\index{monoid}%
A \emph{monoid} is a semigroup with an identity element.
\index{group}%
A \emph{group} is a monoid whose each element has an inverse.

\section{Ring}

A \emph{ring} is \((S,+,\cdot)\) where
\((S,+)\) is an commutative group,
\((S,\cdot)\) is a monoid,
and multiplication distributes addition:
\(x \cdot (y+z) = (x \cdot y) + (x \cdot z)\)
and \((x+y) \cdot z = (x \cdot z) + (y \cdot z)\).
