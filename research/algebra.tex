\section{Group}

\index{binary operation}%
The type of a \emph{binary operation} is \(a \to b \to c\).
\index{binary operation!closed}%
\index{closed binary operation}%
The type of a \emph{closed binary operation} is \(a \to a \to a\).
A binary operation \(\cdot\)
is \emph{associative} iff \(x\cdot(y\cdot z) = (x\cdot y)\cdot z\),
is \emph{commutative} iff \(x \cdot y = y \cdot x\).

\index{magma}%
A \emph{magma} is a set and a closed binary operation.
\index{semigroup}%
A \emph{semigroup} is an associative magma (a magma whose operation is associative).
\index{monoid}%
A \emph{monoid} is a semigroup with an identity element.
\index{group}%
A \emph{group} is a monoid where each element has an inverse.
\index{abelian group}%
\index{commutative group}%
\index{group!abelian}%
\index{group!commutative}%
An \emph{abelian group} or a \emph{commutative group}
is a group whose operation is commutative.

\section{Ring}

A \emph{ring} is \((S,+,\cdot)\) where
\((S,+)\) is an commutative group,
\((S,\cdot)\) is a monoid,
and multiplication distributes addition:
\(x \cdot (y+z) = (x \cdot y) + (x \cdot z)\)
and \((x+y) \cdot z = (x \cdot z) + (y \cdot z)\).

\section{Field}

\(-x\) is the additive inverse of \(x\).

\(x^{-1}\) is the multiplicative inverse of \(x\).

\index{field}%
\((F,+,\cdot,-,{}^{-1},0,1)\) is a \emph{field} iff
\((F,+,-,0)\) is a commutative group,
\((F-\{0\},\cdot,{}^{-1},1)\) is a commutative group,
and \(\cdot\) distributes \(+\) (that is \(x \cdot (y + z) = (x \cdot y) + (x \cdot z)\)) \cite{wpfield}.
For brevity, if \(F\) is a set, ``\(F\) is a field'' means that \((F,+,\cdot,-,{}^{-1},0,1)\) is a field.
That is, for brevity, we blur the distinction between a field and its underlying set.
