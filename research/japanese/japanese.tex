\section{Mindful consistent spaced repetition}

The key to remembering kanji is
\emph{mindful consistent spaced repetition}.
Don't just gloss over the kanji.
\emph{Internalize}.

Don't read one stroke at a time,
but read one component at a time.

\emph{Expect to forget a lot, many times}.
You will forget.
Reread this book.
This book is meant to be read and read again many times.
The aim of this book is to help you optimize your loop.

Mindful consistent spaced repetition is \emph{the only way},
at least until mind-upload is invented.
There is no shortcut.
It's just how the brain works.

The loop:
For each kanji:
Read the kanji out (voice it out).

\section{Target audience}

You read, write, speak, and listen to English but don't read, write, speak, and listen to Japanese.

\section{Memorize the syllabaries}

Memorize all hiragana and katakana.
It's a must.

\section{Understand the principles}

Understand that most kanjis are composed using other kanjis.

Use Wiktionary to found the oracle bone script version of Han characters.

Don't focus on both grammar and vocabulary at the same time.
One who chases two rabbits catches neither.

\section{Read and hear native speakers}

Go to YouTube.
Hear how they speak, even if you don't understand.

Use Google Translate, but do not trust it.
Sometimes it gives the wrong reading.
Use Wiktionary, Wikipedia.

Find Japanese people on Twitter and understand their tweets.

Find Japanese blog posts.

Set up an input method, or use Google Translate.
