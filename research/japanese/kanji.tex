\chapter{Kanji}

Japan borrowed Han characters.

To understand a character, see how it combines with other characters.

To keep you motivated, the characters have been sorted by number of strokes.

TODO: use katakana for Chinese reading and hiragana for Japanese reading.

A kanji can have several readings:
go'on, kan'on, kun-yomi, name reading, and stylistic/idiosyncratic/ad-hoc reading.

The characters are grouped by closeness of meaning:
聞(hear) is grouped under 耳(ear) and not 門(gate).

Information is compiled from Wiktionary
and the Japanese dictionary that comes with gjiten.

新字体（シンジタイ）(lit. new Han-character body)

旧字体（キュウジタイ）(lit. old Han-character body)

\section{Organization}

Usually a Kanji-2 is formed by combining two different Kanji-1
or by decorating a Kanji-1.
Usually a Kanji-3 is formed by combining three different Kanji-1,
or by combining a Kanji-2 and a Kanji-1 without sharing any parts,
or by decorating a Kanji-2.

Let \(m+1 = n\).
A kanji that would be Kanji-\(m\)
can be grouped into Kanji-\(n\) due to its difficulty.
A kanji that would be Kanji-\(n\)
can be grouped into Kanji-\(m\) due to its simplicity.
