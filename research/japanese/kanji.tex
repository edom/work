\chapter{Kanji}

Information is compiled from Wiktionary,
edict, compdic, kanjidic, gjiten,
and Japanese-to-English Google-Translate.

Japanese schoolgoers take 12 years to study 2,000 characters.

\section{History}

Japan borrowed Han characters.

To understand a character, see how it combines with other characters.

To keep you motivated, the characters have been sorted by number of strokes.

A kanji can have several readings:
go'on, kan'on, kun-yomi, name reading, and stylistic/idiosyncratic/ad-hoc reading.

新字体（シンジタイ）(lit. new Han-character body)

旧字体（キュウジタイ）(lit. old Han-character body)

A Latin alphabet letter encodes a \emph{sound}.
You can pronounce the word without understanding it.
A Han character encodes a \emph{concept}.
You can understand the meaning without pronouncing it.

Katakana shows Chinese reading and hiragana shows Japanese reading.

\section{Grouping}

The goal of grouping is to allow the brain to \emph{chunk}.
When the brain recalls any of the member of the group,
it automatically recalls other members of the group.

Use recursive grouping that is 4 levels deep because \(7^4 = 2401\).

\section{Grouping by reducibility}

Chapter \(n\) should not define a kanji
that has more than \(n\) components.
Each section in a chapter groups kanji by semantic closeness
(not by visual closeness).

Example of irreducibility:
台 (tower) is treated as one component;
for pattern recognition purposes,
it is not treated as 厶 stacked on 口.

\section{A possible grouping: scratchiness}

The characters are sorted ascending by ``scratchiness''.
Boxes are less scratchy than lines.
Lines are less scratchy than dots.
Symmetry is less scratchy than asymmetry.
Fewer strokes are less scratchy than more strokes.
However, this is subjective, approximate, and inconsistent.
I don't always follow my own rules.
The goal is to optimize the learning rate of the reader.
The reader is expected to read the character list
sequentially and repeatedly.

Level 1 looks like
an aspiring artist's minimalist abstract paintings.
Level 2 is a combinatorial explosion
of two juxtaposed abstract paintings.
Level 3 ramps up the difficulty even more with more strokes and less symmetry.
Finally, Level 4 looks like total chicken scratch to the uninitiated,
is barely legible on screen even in a 12-point sans-serif font,
and may raise questions such as
``You have a character for that?''
and
``What drug were the sages smoking?''

\section{Another grouping: recency}

Group characters invented in the same period together.
Ancient Chinese concepts,
Old Chinese concepts,
Middle Chinese concepts,
Contemporary Chinese concepts.

\section{Another grouping}

Use visual similarity to group characters by concept.

Visual similarity does not always imply conceptual similarity.
