\chapter{Grammar 1}

Throughout the series, we will build and understand increasingly complex constructions.

\section{Noun}

A noun names something.
The adjective of ``noun'' is ``nominal''.
Japanese nouns do not inflect.
人 can mean person or people, depending on context.

\section{Dictionary-form verb}

Every dictionary-form verb ends with a u-sound (u, ru, su, ku, etc.),
but not every word ending with u-sound is a dictionary-form verb.
Example: 夜（よる）is a noun, not a verb.

食べる（たべる）to eat

歩く（あるく）to walk

笑う（わらう）to laugh

\section{Verbal noun}

A verbal noun is a noun that can be
turned into a dictionary-form verb
by appending ``to do'' such as する, ずる, じる.
Usually the noun was borrowed from another language.
Examples:
感 becomes 感じる (to feel).
信 becomes 信じる (to believe).
安心 becomes 安心する (to relieve) although
心 (heart) by itself is not a verbal noun.
タイプ (from English ``type'') becomes
タイプする (to type; to press the keys of a keyboard).

\section{I-adjective}

黒いblack

細いthin

\section{Adverbiation: -i to -ku}

An adverb modifies a verb or an adjective.

From every i-adjective,
an adverb can be derived by replacing the -i with -ku.
For example: adverbiating 速い (quick) produces 速く (quickly).
This is similar to English appending -ly to adjectives.

速く歩いたwalked quickly

家に速く歩いた。The implied entity walked home quickly.
家に (to home) modifies 速く歩いた (quickly walked).
速く (quickly) modifies 歩いた (walked).

\section{Existence and possession: 有る、在る、居る}

有る（ある）to possess; to have; to own

在る（ある）to exist (for inanimate objects)

居る（いる）to exist (for animate objects)

リンゴが有る。
The implied entity has an apple.

リンゴが在る。
``There is an apple,''
or ``An apple exists,''
depending on context.

犬は居る。
There is a dog.

妹が居る。
The implied entity has a younger sister.

\subsection{In doubt}

What are considered animate?
What are considered inanimate?

\section{Negation: 無い}

Irregular:

ある becomes 無い（ない）: not; not exist

Regular:

v1-ru-to-nai

居る becomes 居ない.

食べる becomes 食べない.

v5-u-to-anai

笑う becomes 笑わない.

Examples:

リンゴが無い。
``The implied entity does not have any apples,''
or ``There are no apples,''
depending on context.

妹が居ない。
