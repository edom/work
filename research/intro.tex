\epigraph{Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them.}{John von Neumann (1903--1957) \cite{zukav1979dancing} (p. 208)}

This book is optimized for slow thoughtful focused sequential reading.
The author has tried his best to make the book as short as possible.

\section{Notation}

A \emph{mathematical notation}, like the Latin alphabet,
is a way of writing \emph{English} or any other natural language.
When you read ``math'',
you are really reading the same language
that you speak everyday.
Like a natural language,
mathematics also has slangs and inconsistencies.

A large part of mathematics is about defining and naming things.
``\(A\) is \(B\) with some additional properties. \(B\) is \(C\) with some other properties.''

When you read a mathematical symbol, think about how it should read in English.

The reader is assumed to know the Greek alphabet.
