\section{Architecture}

Most computers in 2017 have the von Neumann architecture,
which suffers from the von Neumann bottleneck
(the limited transfer rate between CPU and RAM).
This architecture fits programming,
but it fits training less,
and it does not fit learning.
This architecture does not suit machines with billions of sensors.
This architecture does not preclude intelligence
but the bottleneck incurs a great penalty.

\section{An array of FitzHugh-Nagumo cells}

A FitzHugh-Nagumo cell is an electrical circuit implementing the FitzHugh-Nagumo model.
FHN cells can be implemented in Field-programmable Analog Array (FPAA) \cite{CircuitFitzHughNagumo}.
