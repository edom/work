\section{Combining synthetic and analytic geometry? Do we still need this distinction?}

Synthetic geometry uses axioms; it does not use formulas.%
\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_geometry}}

Analytic geometry uses formulas from mathematical analysis.

Analytic geometry is a marriage between analysis and geometry.

When asked "What is a line in a 2-dimensional Euclidean space?",
a student of
synthetic geometry
may answer "It is the infinite extension (in both direction)
of the shortest geometric object connecting two points,"
while a student of
analytic geometry
may answer
``It is $\{ (x,y) ~|~ ax+by=c \text{ where } a,b,c\in\Real \}$.''

Algebraic geometry studies the solution of equations.

Topology studies topological spaces.
Analytic geometry uses coordinates to define spaces,
while topology uses neighborhood to define spaces.

\section{Understanding the advantages of synthetic geometry?}

Why do we begin with synthetic geometry?
Why don't we just go straight to analytic geometry?

\section{Rambling, too abstract}

What makes geometry interesting is not the spaces,
but the mapping between spaces?

(Why are we telling the reader this?)

There are many kinds of spaces we will talk about:

* algebraic structures (especially fields),
* coordinate space (a space of tuples),
* real coordinate space (a space of tuples of real numbers),
* vector space (a coordinate space with vector operations),
* inner product space (a space with an inner product),
* covector space (a space whose member is a covector, defined below).
* tensor space.

There are many ways to make a mapping between two spaces,
as we will see:

* physical field (mapping between two spaces, usually from a coordinate space),
* coordinate system (surjective mapping between two spaces),
* natural vectorization of a ring (mapping from a ring to one of its natural vector spaces),
* basis (linear coordinate system for a vector space),
* covector (linear mapping from a vector space to its ring space),
* cobasis (basis for a covector space).

Then, we will eat our own tail by stating that all those mappings are members of their respective function spaces
(a function space is a space whose members are functions):

* coordinate system transformation (a mapping between two mappings),

\section{Measuring distance using metrics}

With a metric, we can define
a (generalized) circle with radius $r$ and center $c$
to be the set of points
$\{x ~|~ d~c~x = r \}$.

An astronomer may need to tell another astronomer where the latter can find a celestial body.
He can give its coordinates in a coordinate system they have agreed on.
The astronomer can use a celestial coordinate system.

\subsection{Measuring distance with Euclidean metrics}

\index{definitions!Euclidean space}%
The two-dimensional Euclidean space
may be imagined as an unbounded sheet of flat paper.

The \emph{Euclidean metric} for \(\Real^n\) is \( d(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^n (y_k-x_k)^2} \).
It is the length of the shortest straight line segment from \(x\) to \(y\) in Euclidean geometry.
The two-dimensional Euclidean metric is the Pythagorean theorem.

Do not confuse Euclidean metric \(d\) and derivative operator \(d\).

that it permits the methods of the calculus, and, more generally, of
mathematical analysis, to be introduced into geometry.} (p.~1)

\section{Mapping \(\Real^n\) to itself? Why?}

We have shown that we can use a real $n$-tuple as a coordinate to the real $n$-space.
In other words, we can map the real $n$-space to itself.
The identity coordinate system for the real $n$-space is
$I : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ where $I(x) = x$;
this $I$ is also the standard basis for the real $n$-space.

We also call a vector space a linear space.

There is another way to think of a coordinate in $\mathbb{R}^n$:
as a function $N \to \mathbb{R}$ where $N = \{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}$.
We can think of an $n$-dimensional $F$-vector as a function $N \to F$ where $N = \{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}$.
We can forget about dimensions and think of a $F$-vector as a function $\mathbb{N} \to F$.

We can also use vector spaces to talk conveniently about geometric objects.
With vector spaces, we can define a line by vector collinearity,
and define a plane by its normal vector.

Let there be two bases $J$ and $K$.
Let $T$ be coordinate transformation from $J$ to $K$
(that is $J~x = K~(T~x)$)
and $U$ be basis transformation from $J$ to $K$
(that is $K = U~J$).
\[
J~x = (U~J)~(T~x)
\]
\[
J = U \circ J \circ T
\]

Interesting things happen when we change the basis.
$T : E \to F$.

\section{Projective spaces (Why are we talking about this?)}

To grasp projective space, see real projective space.

Descartes's Cartesian coordinate system.

Klein's erlangen program.

Using algebra, we can describe a circle whose radius is $r$
and whose center is the origin in a 2-dimensional Euclidean space with Cartesian coordinate system
as $\{C_2~(x,y) ~|~ x^2+y^2 = r^2\}$.
We can find the intersection of two geometric objects
by solving the system of their equations.

\section{Avoiding the tensor notation in Ricci calculus and the Einstein summation convention?}

% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_calculus
We try not use the tensor notation in Ricci calculus,
of which the Einstein notation is a part.

Every text should be more readable than writable.

\section{Using equations to constrain a system, reducing its degree of freedom? Why are we talking about this?}

% https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_(classical_mechanics)

A \emph{constraint} is?
A constraint is modeled by an equation.
A system is modeled by a set of equations.
The system satisfies all equations in that set.

Example:
The position of an object moving in straight line is modeled by \(x(t) = k t\).

Constraint force is the cause of the constraint.

\subsection{Understanding a system's degree of freedom}

Bead sliding in a straight wire at an angle to gravitational field line.

Motivate degree of freedom with analytic geometry.
To describe a circle, we need two parameters c and r.

The degree of freedom of a system is the minimum number of parameters required to describe it.
Each parameter has type \(\Real\).

\section{Bilinear function? Why are we talking about this?}

A bilinear function \(f\) is left-linear and right-linear:
\(
f(x+z,y) = f(x,y) + f(z,y)
\)
and
\(
f(x,y+z) = f(x,y) + f(x,z)
\).

We can generalize that to multilinearity, but we won't.

* A linear function is multilinear.
* Otherwise a function is multilinear iff every partial application of it is also multilinear.

\section{Measuring the distance between two points on a sphere}

The distance from \(P\) to \(Q\) is \(\angle PCQ \cdot r\)
