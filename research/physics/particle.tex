\section{Black body, temperature, and radiation}

\index{black body!definition}%
\index{definitions!black body}%
A \emph{black body} absorbs all radiation that hits it.

A black body radiates.
The spectrum depends on the body's temperature.

Every temperatured object radiates
because it consists of electrons and
accelerating electron emits electromagnetic radiation?
Because heat is vibration of particles?

\index{braking radiation}%
\index{bremsstrahlung}%
Braking radiation (\emph{bremsstrahlung}) happens for the same reason:
deceleration of charged particle.
Deceleration is negative acceleration.

% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li%C3%A9nard%E2%80%93Wiechert_potential
An accelerating charge radiates because of Li\'enard\textendash{}Wiechert potential?

Does an accelerating charge always radiate?

\section{de Broglie wavelength}

Every particle of momentum \(p\) is also a wave of wavelength \(\lambda = h / p\),
and vice versa: every wave is also a particle?

The \emph{Planck constant} is \( h \approx \SI{6E-34}{J.s} \).

\index{power!radiant}%

The unit of \emph{radiant power} is watt.

\index{definitions!radiant exitance}%
\index{radiant exitance!definition}%
The \emph{radiant exitance} (radiant emittance)
of a surface is the radiant power
emitted by that surface
per unit area of that surface.
\index{radiant exitance!unit (\si{W/m^2})}%
\index{units!radiant exitance (\si{W/m^2})}%

\emph{Stefan\textendash{}Boltzmann law:}
The total radiant exitance of a black body at temperature \(T\) is \( j^\star = \sigma T^4 \).

Let \(h\) be Planck's constant.

Let \(k\) be Boltzmann's constant.

\index{laws!black body radiation}%
\index{laws named after people!Planck's law of black body radiation}%
\emph{Planck's law of black body radiation}:
The \emph{radiance} of a black body for frequency \(f\) at temperature \(T\) is
\begin{equation}
    B(f,T) = \frac{2hf^3}{c^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{hf}{kT}\right) - 1}.
\end{equation}
