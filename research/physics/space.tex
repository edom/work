A space is a set of points.%

\enquote{Space} is another word for \enquote{set}.

\enquote{Point} is another word for \enquote{element}.

Because spaces are sets,
we can use set operations such as intersection and union.
For example, if \(A_1\) is the set of all points on the line \(L_1\),
and \(A_2\) is the set of all points on the line \(L_2\),
then the set intersection \(A_1 \cap A_2\)
is the set of all points where \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) intersect.
A point in \(A_1 \cap A_2\) must be both on \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) simultaneously.
If those lines are parallel (and don't coincide),
then \(A_1 \cap A_2\) is empty,
because those lines don't intersect.

The dimension of a space is a natural number.

A point is an example of a zero-dimensional space.

A line is an example of a one-dimensional space.

A sheet is an example of a two-dimensional space.

A cube is an example of a three-dimensional space.
