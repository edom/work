\chapter{Graph}

A \emph{graph} is \((V,E)\) where
\(V\) is the set of \emph{vertices} and \(E \subseteq V \times V\) is the set of \emph{edges}.

A graph is a relation.

The \emph{length} of a path is the number of edges in that path.

The \emph{geodesic distance} from \(a\) to \(b\) is \(d(a,b)\),
the length of the shortest path from \(a\) to \(b\).

The graph's \emph{fringe} of \(A\) is \(F(A) = \{ b ~|~ a \in A, ~ (a,b) \in E \}\).

Let \(F^{n+1}(A) = F(F^n(A))\).
Property: \(F(\emptyset) = \emptyset\).
Property: \(F(A \cup B) = F(A) \cup F(B)\).
