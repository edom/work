\chapter{Look at things this way.}

Learning is function approximation.
A system learns a function \(f\) iff it approximates \(f\).
The function exists but unknowable. (Does that sentence make sense?)

Learning needs time.

Learning is figuring out a better way.

We say that X learns Y if X does Y better as time goes by.

Learning needs error sensing.
A thing can't learn if it can't sense its error.

Intelligence is function optimization.

\section{Chemotaxis is an example of optimization.}

We can model chemotaxis as gradient following (ascent or descent).
Andrea Schmidt described chemotaxis as a biased random walk.
The bias is the chemical concentration gradient.

Chemotaxis is intelligence.
