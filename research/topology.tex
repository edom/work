\section{Open set topology}

Let \(X\) be a set.
Let \(P(A) = 2^A\) be the power set of \(A\).
We say that \(T \subseteq P(P(X))\) is a \emph{topology} on \(X\) iff
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(\arabic*)}]
    \item \(\{ \emptyset, X \} \subseteq T\),
    \item \(T\) is closed under union, and
    \item \(T\) is closed under intersection.
\end{enumerate*}

A \emph{topological space} is \(S = (X,T)\) where \(X\) is a set and \(T\) is a topology on \(X\).
Each element of \(T\) is an \emph{open set} of \(S\).
