\chapter{Machine learning}

Why are there so many machine learning algorithms?

Machine learning is finding a function
fitting a data list best.

Find a function fitting the data and minimizing the
\index{loss function}%
\emph{loss function}.

Given \([(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_n,y_n)]\),
find \(f\) minimizing \(\sum_k \norm{f(x_k) - y_k}^2\).
