Why are there so many machine learning algorithms?

Machine learning is finding a function
fitting a data list best.

Find a function fitting the data and minimizing the
\index{loss function}%
\emph{loss function}.

Given \([(x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_n,y_n)]\),
find \(f\) minimizing \(\sum_k \norm{f(x_k) - y_k}^2\).

Let \(p, q \in S\) be two points.
Let \(L(p,q) \subseteq S\) be the line segment from \(p\) to \(q\).
The set \(S\) is
\index{convex set}%
\emph{convex} iff \(\forall p,q \in S : L(p,q) \subseteq S\).

A function in \(\Real \to \Real\) is
\index{convex function}%
\emph{convex}
iff the area above its graph is a convex set.
