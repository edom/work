\chapter{Designing a humanoid}

A humanoid is a human-shaped robot.

There are several choices:
Make a machine that resembles human,
Make a cyborg (a human-machine hybrid with more human part),
or Mind upload.

\section{Power plant}

It needs power plant with high power-to-mass and power-to-volume ratio
for long-time low-power and short-time burst scenario.
High-density sugar biobattery \cite{zhu2014high}.
A microbial fuel cell capable of converting glucose to
electricity at high rate and efficiency \cite{rabaey2003microbial}.
Sugar beats lithium ion.

Distributed processing, distributed energy generation.

Citric acid cycle.
Oxidative phosphorylation.

Biomachine hybrid.
A mixture of microbes and machine.

\section{Sensors}

Billions of sensors.
Light, sound, heat, itch, touch, gravity.

A strong enough brain.

How will it sustain itself?

How will it sense the world?

How will it manipulate the world?
