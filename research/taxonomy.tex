Artificial intelligence is constrained optimization.
Brain minimizes free energy \cite{friston2006free,friston2010free}.

Generate vs discriminative.

Type type of an \emph{expert system} is \(Facts \to Query \to Answer\).
Decision tree.
Linearized decision tree.

A learning algorithm is \emph{stable} iff its generalization error is bounded.

\section{Voronoi classifier}

Find out the cluster centers.
Let the Voronoi diagram be the boundary.

\section{Hyperplane classifier}

Let \(h\) be a hyperplane.
Define \(m : \Real^\infty \to \{0,1\}\),
the \emph{hard linear binary classifier} of \(h\),
as \(m~x = [h~x \ge 0]\)
where \([x]\) is 1 iff \(x\) is true or 0 iff \(x\) is false.
Soft classifier: define \(m~x = \tanh^{-1}~(h~x)\).

\section{Support vector machine}

A training point \(x\) is a support of \(h\) iff
it is the closest point to \(h\)
among all points in the class of \(x\).

Alternative formulation:
An upper level is a hyperplane \(h_u\) such that \(\forall a \in U : h_u~a > 0\).
A lower level is a hyperplane \(h_l\) such that \(\forall b \in L : h_l~b < 0\).
Let \(h_u\) and \(h_l\) be parallel.
Maximize the distance between \(h_u\) and \(h_l\).
Then \(h_u\) is the upper margin and \(h_l\) is the lower margin.
Define \(h\) as the hyperplane exactly between \(h_u\) and \(h_l\).

Define \(m : \Real^\infty \to \{0,1\}\),
the \emph{support vector machine} (SVM) of \(h\),
as \(m~x = [h~x \ge 0]\).
Such SVM is a binary classifier.
