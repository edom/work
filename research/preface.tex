\chapter*{Preface}

How much mathematics does one need to understand artificial intelligence?
On Tuesday, 28th February 2017, I set out to answer that.
I wanted to learn about artificial intelligence as fast as possible,
and I thought that the best way to do that was to dive cold turkey into the mathematics.

I wrote this book for the people who use
but don't research mathematics.
My goal is to help them \emph{quickly} understand
the mathematics they need to do their job.
Easy and correct are \emph{not} parts of the goal.
Wrong-but-useful is preferred to correct-but-irrelevant.
Proofs are omitted.
The approach is formal, but not rigorous.

There is nothing new in this book.
It just presents existing materials
in an order optimized for understanding.
