How much mathematics does one need to understand artificial intelligence?
On Tuesday, 28th February 2017, I set out to answer that.
I wanted to learn about artificial intelligence as fast as possible,
and I thought that the best way to do that was to dive cold turkey into the mathematics.

I write this book for myself
to find out whether I understand things;
I understand something when I can explain it.

The approach is formal, but not rigorous.
Wrong-but-useful is preferred to correct-but-irrelevant.
Proofs that can be found on the Internet are omitted.

I believe that definitions
are keys that open doors to theorems.

This book only covers a very small part of mathematics.
For an overview of how big mathematics is,
see the Mathematics Subject Classification.
