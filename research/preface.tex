\chapter*{Preface}

How much mathematics does one need to understand artificial intelligence?
On Tuesday, 28th February 2017, I set out to answer that.
I wanted to learn about artificial intelligence as fast as possible,
and I thought that the best way to do that was to dive cold turkey into the mathematics.

I wrote this book for people who use but don't research mathematics.
I want to help the readers get used \emph{quickly} to the mathematics they need to do their job.
Easy and correct are \emph{not} parts of the goal.

The approach is formal, but not rigorous.
Wrong-but-useful is preferred to correct-but-irrelevant.
Proofs are omitted.

This book only covers a very small part of mathematics.
For an overview of how big mathematics is,
see the Mathematics Subject Classification.
