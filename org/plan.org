*** [2018-09-11] Microeconomics

An economy consists of actors.

- No economic actor has complete view of the economy.
  Every actor can only see his suppliers and consumers.
- Every actor responds only to what immediately affects it: its direct suppliers and consumers.
- Actors need time to respond to change in demand/supply.
- Some actors maintain buffers/inventories.
- Some actors get involved in futures.

Hypotheses:

- Shocks ripple through actors.
- For non-vital things, demand collapse is more dangerous than supply collapse. Wasted inventory.

Statistics can give us an accurate picture of the economy.
Random sampling of actors.
