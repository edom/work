# Assorted work in progress

## Featured

* [java-build/plugin/gradle](java-build/plugin/gradle/)
    * DependencyResolutionPlugin: intersect dependency version ranges
    * GeneratePomPlugin: augment the POM generated by the Gradle Maven plugin
    so that the POM can be used for building with Maven 3.
    This does not generate the root aggregating POM.
    This overwrites the pom.xml files.
* Locking across different processes
    * [concurrent/lock](concurrent/lock/)
    * [concurrent/lock-client](concurrent/lock-client/)
    * [concurrent/lock-server](concurrent/lock-server/)
* Batching
    * [concurrent/batch](concurrent/batch/)
* Minimalistic Javadoc stylesheet
    * [javadoc.css](javadoc.css)
        * I made this stylesheet because Java 8's default stylesheet
        uses monospaced font for parameter description.

## Notes on the pom.xml files

Do not edit pom.xml files manually. They are generated.

To delete all pom.xml files,
cd to the directory containing this readme,
and run this:

```
find -name pom.xml -delete
```

To generate the pom.xml files, use IntelliJ IDEA to run
[Mavenize.java](/internal/src/main/java/com/spacetimecat/build/java/internal/Mavenize.java).
