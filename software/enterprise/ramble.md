# What is this?

## How should we see this?

Which of these are true about this system?

- too simplistic, but quickly understandable by programmers
    - a Java web framework written in Prolog
    - a Java+JavaScript full-stack web framework written in Prolog
    - a very rigid, limited, and opinionated framework
    - a web application generator
    - an enterprise application generator
    - a software template
    - a software factory
    - a very high-level programming language (if Java is high-level)
- hopes and dreams
    - a Prolog alternative to UML, rooted in logic,
    without the OOP scars left by the 1990s Method Wars
    - a way of programming in the language of thought
    - a system in which programmers specialize into language designers and language users
    instead of into back-ends and front-ends
    - a system that captures essential complexity
    - an ontology
    - a meta-model
    - a meta-programming tool
    - a program generation tool
    - a program derivation tool
    - an executable specification language
    - an instance of model-driven software engineering
- borderline-insane
    - a 10x-software-engineer's tool
    - a 100,000x-software-enginer's tool,
    if you can make 100 other people use it
    and make them teach it to 100 other people each
    - a silver bullet, a panacea
    - a possible future of software engineering
